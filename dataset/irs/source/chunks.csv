"content: The IRS sponsors volunteer assistance programs offering help to taxpayers in many community locations.

VITA

The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA) offers free tax help by trained volunteers for low to moderate-income taxpayers. VITA sites provide free basic income tax return preparation for individuals and are available locally in most community locations. To see if you qualify for this service, see Free Tax Return Preparation for Qualifying Taxpayers.

Trained volunteers can help you determine your eligibility for special credits such as the earned income tax credit, child tax credit, and credit for the elderly or the disabled.

VITA sites offer free electronic filing (e-file). Individuals who use the e-file program benefit from a shorter processing time and usually receive their refunds more quickly. Taxpayers who use e-file and direct deposit can usually expect to get their refund within 21 days. Note: You should only choose direct deposit of your refund into accounts that are in your own name, your spouse's name, or both if it's a joint account.

To find the locations, dates and hours of availability for the volunteer sites near you, use the VITA locator tool, see Publication 5136PDF, download the free IRS2Go app, or call 800-906-9887.

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the IRS and the Taxpayer Advocate Service. LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee.



When the preparation of a return or returns is necessary to resolve a dispute with the IRS, an LITC can prepare the return. A taxpayer's decision to obtain representation from an LITC won't result in the IRS giving preferential treatment in handling the taxpayer's dispute.

For more information or to find an LITC near you, see Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITC) or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic ListPDF.

"content: Refund timing

The IRS issues more than 9 out of 10 refunds in the normal time frame: less than 21 days. However, it’s possible that some tax returns may require further review and could result in the refund being delayed.

Some common issues which may extend processing times:

You mailed your return.

You’re expecting a refund from an amended return. Refer to Where’s my amended return? for more information, including processing timeframes.

If you filed an injured spouse claim, refer to injured spouse relief for more information.

For refund claims with an application for an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) attached, refer to Topic no. 857 for more information.

If you requested a refund of tax withheld on a Form 1042-S by filing a Form 1040-NR, allow up to 6 months from the original due date of the 1040-NR return or the date you filed the 1040-NR, whichever is later, to receive any refund due.

The IRS expects the earliest Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by February 27 if you chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with the tax return. However, some taxpayers may see their refunds a few days earlier. Check Where's my refund? for your personalized refund date.

Refund type

Join the eight in 10 taxpayers who get their refunds faster by using e-file and direct deposit. You have several options for receiving your federal individual income tax refund:

Direct deposit: The fastest way is by direct deposit into your checking or savings account, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States. See the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) PDF for more information. The account must be in your name. In an effort to combat fraud and identity theft, the IRS limits the number of direct deposits into a single financial account or prepaid debit card to three refunds per year. Taxpayers who exceed this limit will receive a notice and a refund check instead, which may take up to 10 weeks;

Splitting your refund

If you choose to receive your refund by direct deposit, you can split your refund into as many as three separate accounts. For example, you can request that we directly deposit into a checking, a savings, and a retirement account by completing Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) and attaching it to your income tax return. You can also use Form 8888 to buy up to $5,000 in series I savings bonds. You can't have your refund deposited into more than one account or buy paper series I savings bonds if you file Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation. As a reminder, your refund should only be directly deposited into accounts that are in your own name, your spouse's name, or both if it's a joint account. Your refund should not be direct deposited into an account in your return preparer's name. Please note, to receive your refund by direct deposit (whether into one account or more), the total refund amount must be $1 or more.

Splitting your refund"|"Refund timing

The IRS issues more than 9 out of 10 refunds in the normal time frame: less than 21 days. However, it’s possible that some tax returns may require further review and could result in the refund being delayed.

Some common issues which may extend processing times:

You mailed your return.

You’re expecting a refund from an amended return. Refer to Where’s my amended return? for more information, including processing timeframes.

If you filed an injured spouse claim, refer to injured spouse relief for more information.

For refund claims with an application for an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) attached, refer to Topic no. 857 for more information.

If you requested a refund of tax withheld on a Form 1042-S by filing a Form 1040-NR, allow up to 6 months from the original due date of the 1040-NR return or the date you filed the 1040-NR, whichever is later, to receive any refund due.

The IRS expects the earliest Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by February 27 if you chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with the tax return. However, some taxpayers may see their refunds a few days earlier. Check Where's my refund? for your personalized refund date.

You can also refer to Topic no. 303 for a checklist of common errors made when preparing your tax return and for additional items that may delay the processing of your return.

Call us about your refund status only if Where's my refund? recommends you to contact us.

Refund type

Join the eight in 10 taxpayers who get their refunds faster by using e-file and direct deposit. You have several options for receiving your federal individual income tax refund:

Direct deposit: The fastest way is by direct deposit into your checking or savings account, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States. See the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) PDF for more information. The account must be in your name. In an effort to combat fraud and identity theft, the IRS limits the number of direct deposits into a single financial account or prepaid debit card to three refunds per year. Taxpayers who exceed this limit will receive a notice and a refund check instead, which may take up to 10 weeks;

Splitting your refund

If you choose to receive your refund by direct deposit, you can split your refund into as many as three separate accounts. For example, you can request that we directly deposit into a checking, a savings, and a retirement account by completing Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) and attaching it to your income tax return. You can also use Form 8888 to buy up to $5,000 in series I savings bonds. You can't have your refund deposited into more than one account or buy paper series I savings bonds if you file Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation. As a reminder, your refund should only be directly deposited into accounts that are in your own name, your spouse's name, or both if it's a joint account. Your refund should not be direct deposited into an account in your return preparer's name. Please note, to receive your refund by direct deposit (whether into one account or more), the total refund amount must be $1 or more.

The IRS expects the earliest Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by February 27 if you chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with the tax return. However, some taxpayers may see their refunds a few days earlier. Check Where's my refund? for your personalized refund date.

You can also refer to Topic no. 303 for a checklist of common errors made when preparing your tax return and for additional items that may delay the processing of your return.

Call us about your refund status only if Where's my refund? recommends you to contact us.

Refund type

Join the eight in 10 taxpayers who get their refunds faster by using e-file and direct deposit. You have several options for receiving your federal individual income tax refund:

Direct deposit: The fastest way is by direct deposit into your checking or savings account, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States. See the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) PDF for more information. The account must be in your name. In an effort to combat fraud and identity theft, the IRS limits the number of direct deposits into a single financial account or prepaid debit card to three refunds per year. Taxpayers who exceed this limit will receive a notice and a refund check instead, which may take up to 10 weeks;

Deposit into a TreasuryDirect® online account to buy savings bonds. For more information, go to treasurydirect.gov; Traditional, Roth, or SEP-IRA: Directly deposit part or all of your refund into a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP-IRA, but not a SIMPLE IRA. You must have an existing IRA account before you file your return, and your routing number and account number. See the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) for more information. For more information on IRA contributions, see Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs);

You must have an existing IRA account before you file your return, and your routing number and account number. See the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) for more information. For more information on IRA contributions, see Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs); Form 8888: By purchase of U.S. Series I Savings Bonds up to $5,000; or

By purchase of U.S. Series I Savings Bonds up to $5,000; or Paper check: By paper check sent to the address listed on your return.

Splitting your refund

If you choose to receive your refund by direct deposit, you can split your refund into as many as three separate accounts. For example, you can request that we directly deposit into a checking, a savings, and a retirement account by completing Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) and attaching it to your income tax return. You can also use Form 8888 to buy up to $5,000 in series I savings bonds. You can't have your refund deposited into more than one account or buy paper series I savings bonds if you file Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation. As a reminder, your refund should only be directly deposited into accounts that are in your own name, your spouse's name, or both if it's a joint account. Your refund should not be direct deposited into an account in your return preparer's name. Please note, to receive your refund by direct deposit (whether into one account or more), the total refund amount must be $1 or more.

Online or mobile device

Where's my refund? has the most up to date information available about your refund. Use it to get your personalized refund status. The tool is updated once a day, so you don't need to check more often. You can also download our free mobile app, IRS2Go, from an iPhone or Android device to check Where's my refund?

Checking your refund status

You can start checking on the status of your refund within:

24 hours after e-filing a tax year 2023 return

3 or 4 days after e-filing a tax year 2021 or 2022 return

4 weeks after mailing a return

Have your tax return handy so you can provide your taxpayer identification number, your filing status, and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund shown on your return.

General information

Where's my refund? provides information for the current and two previous tax years. If you need other return information, view Your Online Account.

Where's my refund? includes a tracker that displays progress through 3 stages: (1) Return received, (2) Refund approved, and (3) Refund sent. Where's my refund? provides a personalized refund date as soon as the IRS processes your tax return and approves your refund. It doesn't show information about amended returns. To check the status of an amended return, use Where's my amended return?

Where's my refund? has the most accurate and complete refund information available. IRS representatives don't have information beyond what's shown on Where's my refund? so you don't need to call the IRS unless the tool says we can provide more information to you. Updates to refund status are made once a day - usually at night.

Telephone access

If you don't have Internet access, you may call the refund hotline at 800-829-1954 to check on your tax year 2023 refund. To check on an amended return, call 866-464-2050.

Not entitled to refund received

If you receive a refund to which you're not entitled, or for an amount that's more than you expected, don't cash the check. For a direct deposit that was greater than expected, immediately contact the IRS at 800-829-1040 and your bank or financial institution. If you receive a notice from the IRS explaining an adjustment to a refund amount, you should do as instructed in the notice. For information about returning an erroneous refund, see Topic no. 161.

Refund less than expected

If you receive a refund for a smaller amount than you expected, you may cash the check. You'll get a notice explaining the difference. Follow the instructions on the notice. If it's determined that you should have received more, you will later receive a check for the difference.

Missing refund check

If your refund check is lost, stolen or destroyed, the IRS will initiate a refund trace to determine the status of the refund. See I lost my refund check. How do I get a new one?

"content: If you don't pay your tax in full when you file your tax return, you'll receive a bill for the amount you owe. This bill starts the collection process, which continues until your account is satisfied or until the IRS may no longer legally collect the tax; for example, when the time or period for collection expires.

The first notice you receive will be a letter that explains the balance due and demands payment in full. It will include the amount of the tax, plus any penalties and interest accrued on your unpaid balance from the date the tax was due.

The unpaid balance is subject to interest that compounds daily and a monthly late payment penalty up to the maximum allowed by law. It's in your best interest to pay your tax liability in full as soon as you can to minimize the penalty and interest charges. You may want to consider other methods of financing full payment of your taxes, such as obtaining a cash advance on your credit card or getting a bank loan. The rate and any applicable fees your credit card company or bank charges may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. If you can't pay in full, you should send in as much as you can with the notice and explore other payment arrangements."|"If you don't pay your tax in full when you file your tax return, you'll receive a bill for the amount you owe.

If you can't pay in full, you should send in as much as you can with the notice and explore other payment arrangements.

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately, you may qualify for a payment plan. One option is a short-term payment plan of up to 180 days, available for individual taxpayers who owe less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties, and interest. If you cannot pay immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify to pay monthly through an installment agreement. You can apply for a payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) Application or you may complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request and mail it in with your bill. You may also request an installment agreement over the phone by calling the phone number listed on your balance due notice.

There's a user fee to set up an installment agreement. For low-income taxpayers, the user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed if certain conditions apply. Interest and late payment penalties up to the maximum allowed by law will continue to accrue while you make installment payments. For more information about payment plans and payment methods, see Additional Information on Payment Plans and Topic no. 202.

If you can't full pay under an installment agreement, you may apply for an Offer in Compromise (OIC). An OIC is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS that resolves a taxpayer's tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before an offer can be considered, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't eligible. To confirm eligibility, you may use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

If you need more time to pay, you may ask that we delay collection and report your account as currently not collectible. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt due to a financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF, or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (explained below), until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (explained below) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed on your bill to discuss this option. For additional information on currently not collectible, refer to Topic no. 202.

If you're a member of the Armed Forces, you may be able to defer payment. See Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.

It's important to contact us and make arrangements to pay the tax due voluntarily. If you don't contact us, we may take action to collect the taxes.

We may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien in the public record to notify your creditors of your tax debt. A federal tax lien is a legal claim to your property, including property that you acquire after the lien arises. The federal tax lien arises automatically when the IRS sends the first notice demanding payment of the tax debt assessed against you and you fail to pay the amount in full. The filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien may affect your ability to obtain credit although it no longer appears on major credit reports. Once a lien arises, the IRS generally can't release the lien until the tax, penalty, interest, and recording fees are paid in full or until the IRS may no longer legally collect the tax. Paying your tax debt in full is the best way to get rid of a federal tax lien. The IRS releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt.

In certain situations, the IRS may withdraw a Notice of Federal Tax Lien even when you still owe the tax debt. The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be withdrawn if the IRS determines:

The Notice of Federal Tax Lien was not filed according to IRS procedures; You entered into an installment agreement to satisfy the liability unless the installment agreement provided for the Notice of Federal Tax Lien; Withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien will allow you to pay your taxes more quickly; or With your consent or that of the National Taxpayer Advocate, withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien is in your best interest and in the best interest of the government.

The IRS may levy (seize) assets such as wages, bank accounts, Social Security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS also may seize your property (including your car, boat, or real estate) and sell the property to satisfy the tax debt. In addition, any future federal tax refunds or state income tax refunds that you're due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.

You may call the IRS at 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation) to discuss any IRS bill. Please have the bill and your records with you when you call.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process. For more information, refer to Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF, and Publication 1660, Collection Appeal RightsPDF.

It's in your best interest to pay your tax liability in full as soon as you can to minimize the penalty and interest charges. You may want to consider other methods of financing full payment of your taxes, such as obtaining a cash advance on your credit card or getting a bank loan. The rate and any applicable fees your credit card company or bank charges may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. If you can't pay in full, you should send in as much as you can with the notice and explore other payment arrangements.

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately, you may qualify for a payment plan. One option is a short-term payment plan of up to 180 days, available for individual taxpayers who owe less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties, and interest. If you cannot pay immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify to pay monthly through an installment agreement. You can apply for a payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) Application or you may complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request and mail it in with your bill. You may also request an installment agreement over the phone by calling the phone number listed on your balance due notice.

There's a user fee to set up an installment agreement. For low-income taxpayers, the user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed if certain conditions apply. Interest and late payment penalties up to the maximum allowed by law will continue to accrue while you make installment payments. For more information about payment plans and payment methods, see Additional Information on Payment Plans and Topic no. 202.

If you can't full pay under an installment agreement, you may apply for an Offer in Compromise (OIC). An OIC is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS that resolves a taxpayer's tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before an offer can be considered, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't eligible. To confirm eligibility, you may use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

If you need more time to pay, you may ask that we delay collection and report your account as currently not collectible. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt due to a financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF, or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (explained below), until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (explained below) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed on your bill to discuss this option. For additional information on currently not collectible, refer to Topic no. 202.

If you're a member of the Armed Forces, you may be able to defer payment. See Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.

It's important to contact us and make arrangements to pay the tax due voluntarily. If you don't contact us, we may take action to collect the taxes.

We may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien in the public record to notify your creditors of your tax debt. A federal tax lien is a legal claim to your property, including property that you acquire after the lien arises. The federal tax lien arises automatically when the IRS sends the first notice demanding payment of the tax debt assessed against you and you fail to pay the amount in full. The filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien may affect your ability to obtain credit although it no longer appears on major credit reports. Once a lien arises, the IRS generally can't release the lien until the tax, penalty, interest, and recording fees are paid in full or until the IRS may no longer legally collect the tax. Paying your tax debt in full is the best way to get rid of a federal tax lien. The IRS releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt.

In certain situations, the IRS may withdraw a Notice of Federal Tax Lien even when you still owe the tax debt. The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be withdrawn if the IRS determines:

The Notice of Federal Tax Lien was not filed according to IRS procedures; You entered into an installment agreement to satisfy the liability unless the installment agreement provided for the Notice of Federal Tax Lien; Withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien will allow you to pay your taxes more quickly; or With your consent or that of the National Taxpayer Advocate, withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien is in your best interest and in the best interest of the government.

The IRS may levy (seize) assets such as wages, bank accounts, Social Security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS also may seize your property (including your car, boat, or real estate) and sell the property to satisfy the tax debt. In addition, any future federal tax refunds or state income tax refunds that you're due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.

You may call the IRS at 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation) to discuss any IRS bill. Please have the bill and your records with you when you call.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process. For more information, refer to Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF, and Publication 1660, Collection Appeal RightsPDF.

Interest and late payment penalties up to the maximum allowed by law will continue to accrue while you make installment payments. For more information about payment plans and payment methods, see Additional Information on Payment Plans and Topic no. 202.

If you can't full pay under an installment agreement, you may apply for an Offer in Compromise (OIC). An OIC is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS that resolves a taxpayer's tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before an offer can be considered, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't eligible. To confirm eligibility, you may use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

If you need more time to pay, you may ask that we delay collection and report your account as currently not collectible. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt due to a financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF, or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (explained below), until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (explained below) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed on your bill to discuss this option. For additional information on currently not collectible, refer to Topic no. 202.

If you're a member of the Armed Forces, you may be able to defer payment. See Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.

It's important to contact us and make arrangements to pay the tax due voluntarily. If you don't contact us, we may take action to collect the taxes.

We may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien in the public record to notify your creditors of your tax debt. A federal tax lien is a legal claim to your property, including property that you acquire after the lien arises. The federal tax lien arises automatically when the IRS sends the first notice demanding payment of the tax debt assessed against you and you fail to pay the amount in full. The filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien may affect your ability to obtain credit although it no longer appears on major credit reports. Once a lien arises, the IRS generally can't release the lien until the tax, penalty, interest, and recording fees are paid in full or until the IRS may no longer legally collect the tax. Paying your tax debt in full is the best way to get rid of a federal tax lien. The IRS releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt.

In certain situations, the IRS may withdraw a Notice of Federal Tax Lien even when you still owe the tax debt. The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be withdrawn if the IRS determines:

The Notice of Federal Tax Lien was not filed according to IRS procedures; You entered into an installment agreement to satisfy the liability unless the installment agreement provided for the Notice of Federal Tax Lien; Withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien will allow you to pay your taxes more quickly; or With your consent or that of the National Taxpayer Advocate, withdrawing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien is in your best interest and in the best interest of the government.

The IRS may levy (seize) assets such as wages, bank accounts, Social Security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS also may seize your property (including your car, boat, or real estate) and sell the property to satisfy the tax debt. In addition, any future federal tax refunds or state income tax refunds that you're due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.

You may call the IRS at 800-829-1040 (see telephone assistance for hours of operation) to discuss any IRS bill. Please have the bill and your records with you when you call.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process. For more information, refer to Taxpayer Bill of Rights, Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF, and Publication 1660, Collection Appeal RightsPDF.

Complete the five easy steps and you'll receive instant confirmation after you submit your payment. With Direct Pay, you can use the ""Look Up a Payment"" feature to view your payment details and status. You can opt in to receive email notifications about your payment.

In addition, you can pay using your bank account or a debit card, credit card or digital wallet or apply for an online payment agreement if you need more time to pay.

If you decide to pay by mail, enclose a check or money order with a copy of your tax return or notice. Make it payable to the United States Treasury and provide your name, address, daytime phone number, taxpayer identification number, tax year, and form or notice number (for example, 2023 Form 1040) on the front of your payment.

If you can't pay in full, you should pay as much as possible to reduce the accrual of interest on your account. Please refer to Topic no. 158 for information needed to ensure proper credit of your payment. You should consider financing the full payment of your tax liability through loans, such as a home equity loan from a financial institution or a credit card. The interest rate and any applicable fees charged by a bank or credit card company may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties set by the Internal Revenue Code.

Short-term payment plans (up to 180 days)

If you can't pay in full immediately, you may qualify for additional time --up to 180 days-- to pay in full. There's no fee for this full payment; however, interest and any applicable penalties continue to accrue until your liability is paid in full. Individuals may be able to set up a short-term payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) application or by calling us at 800-829-1040 (individuals). See telephone assistance for hours of availability.

Payment plans (Installment agreements)

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify for a monthly payment plan (including an installment agreement). To request a payment plan, use the OPA application, complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and mail it to us, or call the appropriate telephone number listed below. A payment plan allows you to make a series of monthly payments over time. The IRS offers various options for making monthly payments:

Direct debit from your bank account,

Payroll deduction from your employer,

Payment by EFTPS,

Payment by credit card or debit card via phone or Internet,

Payment via check or money order,

Payment with cash at a retail partner. For all accepted payment methods, see Payments.

The IRS charges a user fee when you enter into a payment plan; however, if you are a low-income taxpayer, this user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed when certain conditions apply. See Additional Information on Payment Plans for more details.

If you are filing a Form 1040 for the current tax year and cannot pay the balance in full:

You may request a payment plan (including an installment agreement) using the OPA application. Even if the IRS hasn't yet issued you a bill, you may establish a pre-assessed agreement by entering the balance you'll owe from your tax return. OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

You may also request a payment plan by calling the toll-free number on your bill, or if you don't have a bill, call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses).

Before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't generally eligible. You must specify the amount you can pay and the day of the month (1st through 28th). Your payment must be received by the IRS on your due date. If you plan on mailing your payment, consider mailing time when you select a payment day. OPA will provide an immediate determination for your proposed payment plan. If you mail Form 9465, the IRS will respond to your request typically within 30 days but it may take longer during filing season.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

If you're not able to make any payment at this time, please have your financial information available (for example, pay stubs, lease or rental agreements, mortgage statements, car lease/loan, utilities) and call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses) for assistance.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process; see Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer. If you would like information about payment arrangements, installment agreements, and what happens when you take no action to pay, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF.

If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Payment plans (Installment agreements)

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify for a monthly payment plan (including an installment agreement). To request a payment plan, use the OPA application, complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and mail it to us, or call the appropriate telephone number listed below. A payment plan allows you to make a series of monthly payments over time. The IRS offers various options for making monthly payments:

Direct debit from your bank account,

Payroll deduction from your employer,

Payment by EFTPS,

Payment by credit card or debit card via phone or Internet,

Payment via check or money order,

Payment with cash at a retail partner. For all accepted payment methods, see Payments.

The IRS charges a user fee when you enter into a payment plan; however, if you are a low-income taxpayer, this user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed when certain conditions apply. See Additional Information on Payment Plans for more details.

If you are filing a Form 1040 for the current tax year and cannot pay the balance in full:

You may request a payment plan (including an installment agreement) using the OPA application. Even if the IRS hasn't yet issued you a bill, you may establish a pre-assessed agreement by entering the balance you'll owe from your tax return. OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

You may also request a payment plan by calling the toll-free number on your bill, or if you don't have a bill, call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses).

Before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't generally eligible. You must specify the amount you can pay and the day of the month (1st through 28th). Your payment must be received by the IRS on your due date. If you plan on mailing your payment, consider mailing time when you select a payment day. OPA will provide an immediate determination for your proposed payment plan. If you mail Form 9465, the IRS will respond to your request typically within 30 days but it may take longer during filing season.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days.

If you can't pay in full, you should pay as much as possible to reduce the accrual of interest on your account. Please refer to Topic no. 158 for information needed to ensure proper credit of your payment. You should consider financing the full payment of your tax liability through loans, such as a home equity loan from a financial institution or a credit card. The interest rate and any applicable fees charged by a bank or credit card company may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties set by the Internal Revenue Code.

Short-term payment plans (up to 180 days)

If you can't pay in full immediately, you may qualify for additional time --up to 180 days-- to pay in full. There's no fee for this full payment; however, interest and any applicable penalties continue to accrue until your liability is paid in full. Individuals may be able to set up a short-term payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) application or by calling us at 800-829-1040 (individuals). See telephone assistance for hours of availability.

Payment plans (Installment agreements)

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify for a monthly payment plan (including an installment agreement). To request a payment plan, use the OPA application, complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and mail it to us, or call the appropriate telephone number listed below. A payment plan allows you to make a series of monthly payments over time. The IRS offers various options for making monthly payments:

Direct debit from your bank account,

Payroll deduction from your employer,

Payment by EFTPS,

Payment by credit card or debit card via phone or Internet,

Payment via check or money order,

Payment with cash at a retail partner. For all accepted payment methods, see Payments.

The IRS charges a user fee when you enter into a payment plan; however, if you are a low-income taxpayer, this user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed when certain conditions apply. See Additional Information on Payment Plans for more details.

If you are filing a Form 1040 for the current tax year and cannot pay the balance in full:

You may request a payment plan (including an installment agreement) using the OPA application. Even if the IRS hasn't yet issued you a bill, you may establish a pre-assessed agreement by entering the balance you'll owe from your tax return. OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

If you're not able to make any payment at this time, please have your financial information available (for example, pay stubs, lease or rental agreements, mortgage statements, car lease/loan, utilities) and call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses) for assistance.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process; see Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer. If you would like information about payment arrangements, installment agreements, and what happens when you take no action to pay, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF.

You can also modify or cancel your payment up to two business days before your scheduled payment date.

You can access your federal tax account information through a secure login at Your Online Account. You can view the amount you owe along with details of your balance, view your payment history, access Get Your Tax Record to download or print your tax records, and view key information from your current year tax return as originally filed. In addition, you can pay using your bank account or a debit card, credit card or digital wallet or apply for an online payment agreement if you need more time to pay.

If you decide to pay by mail, enclose a check or money order with a copy of your tax return or notice. Make it payable to the United States Treasury and provide your name, address, daytime phone number, taxpayer identification number, tax year, and form or notice number (for example, 2023 Form 1040) on the front of your payment.

If you can't pay in full, you should pay as much as possible to reduce the accrual of interest on your account. Please refer to Topic no. 158 for information needed to ensure proper credit of your payment. You should consider financing the full payment of your tax liability through loans, such as a home equity loan from a financial institution or a credit card. The interest rate and any applicable fees charged by a bank or credit card company may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties set by the Internal Revenue Code.

Short-term payment plans (up to 180 days)

If you can't pay in full immediately, you may qualify for additional time --up to 180 days-- to pay in full. There's no fee for this full payment; however, interest and any applicable penalties continue to accrue until your liability is paid in full. Individuals may be able to set up a short-term payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) application or by calling us at 800-829-1040 (individuals). See telephone assistance for hours of availability.

Payment plans (Installment agreements)

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify for a monthly payment plan (including an installment agreement). To request a payment plan, use the OPA application, complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and mail it to us, or call the appropriate telephone number listed below. A payment plan allows you to make a series of monthly payments over time. The IRS offers various options for making monthly payments:

Direct debit from your bank account,

Payroll deduction from your employer,

Payment by EFTPS,

Payment by credit card or debit card via phone or Internet,

Payment via check or money order,

Payment with cash at a retail partner. For all accepted payment methods, see Payments.

The IRS charges a user fee when you enter into a payment plan; however, if you are a low-income taxpayer, this user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed when certain conditions apply. See Additional Information on Payment Plans for more details.

If you are filing a Form 1040 for the current tax year and cannot pay the balance in full:

You may request a payment plan (including an installment agreement) using the OPA application. Even if the IRS hasn't yet issued you a bill, you may establish a pre-assessed agreement by entering the balance you'll owe from your tax return. OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

You may also request a payment plan by calling the toll-free number on your bill, or if you don't have a bill, call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses).

Before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't generally eligible. You must specify the amount you can pay and the day of the month (1st through 28th). Your payment must be received by the IRS on your due date. If you plan on mailing your payment, consider mailing time when you select a payment day. OPA will provide an immediate determination for your proposed payment plan. If you mail Form 9465, the IRS will respond to your request typically within 30 days but it may take longer during filing season.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

If you're not able to make any payment at this time, please have your financial information available (for example, pay stubs, lease or rental agreements, mortgage statements, car lease/loan, utilities) and call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses) for assistance.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process; see Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer. If you would like information about payment arrangements, installment agreements, and what happens when you take no action to pay, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF.

OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

You may also request a payment plan by calling the toll-free number on your bill, or if you don't have a bill, call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses).

Before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't generally eligible. You must specify the amount you can pay and the day of the month (1st through 28th). Your payment must be received by the IRS on your due date. If you plan on mailing your payment, consider mailing time when you select a payment day. OPA will provide an immediate determination for your proposed payment plan. If you mail Form 9465, the IRS will respond to your request typically within 30 days but it may take longer during filing season.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

If you're not able to make any payment at this time, please have your financial information available (for example, pay stubs, lease or rental agreements, mortgage statements, car lease/loan, utilities) and call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses) for assistance.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process; see Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer. If you would like information about payment arrangements, installment agreements, and what happens when you take no action to pay, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF.

There's also a penalty for failure to file a tax return, so you should file timely even if you can't pay your balance in full. It's always in your best interest to pay in full as soon as you can to minimize the additional charges.

Paying electronically is a convenient way to pay your federal taxes online, by phone for EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or card payments, or digital wallet, or from a mobile device. Electronic payment options are available on our payments page and the IRS2Go app. When paying electronically, you can schedule your payment in advance. You'll receive instant confirmation after you submit your payment. You can opt in to receive email notifications about your payments. The IRS uses the latest encryption technology making electronic payments safe and secure. It's quick, easy, and much faster than mailing in a check or money order.

IRS Direct Pay is a secure service you can use to pay your taxes for Form 1040 series, estimated taxes or other associated forms directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you. Complete the five easy steps and you'll receive instant confirmation after you submit your payment.

In addition, you can pay using your bank account or a debit card, credit card or digital wallet or apply for an online payment agreement if you need more time to pay.

If you decide to pay by mail, enclose a check or money order with a copy of your tax return or notice. Make it payable to the United States Treasury and provide your name, address, daytime phone number, taxpayer identification number, tax year, and form or notice number (for example, 2023 Form 1040) on the front of your payment.

If you can't pay in full, you should pay as much as possible to reduce the accrual of interest on your account. Please refer to Topic no. 158 for information needed to ensure proper credit of your payment. You should consider financing the full payment of your tax liability through loans, such as a home equity loan from a financial institution or a credit card. The interest rate and any applicable fees charged by a bank or credit card company may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties set by the Internal Revenue Code.

Short-term payment plans (up to 180 days)

If you can't pay in full immediately, you may qualify for additional time --up to 180 days-- to pay in full. There's no fee for this full payment; however, interest and any applicable penalties continue to accrue until your liability is paid in full. Individuals may be able to set up a short-term payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) application or by calling us at 800-829-1040 (individuals). See telephone assistance for hours of availability.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

You’re financially unable to pay the liability in full when due.

If you do not qualify for the above installment agreements, you may still be eligible for an installment agreement. However, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination and a collection information statement may be required.

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

There's also a penalty for failure to file a tax return, so you should file timely even if you can't pay your balance in full. It's always in your best interest to pay in full as soon as you can to minimize the additional charges.

Paying electronically is a convenient way to pay your federal taxes online, by phone for EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or card payments, or digital wallet, or from a mobile device. Electronic payment options are available on our payments page and the IRS2Go app. When paying electronically, you can schedule your payment in advance. You'll receive instant confirmation after you submit your payment. You can opt in to receive email notifications about your payments. The IRS uses the latest encryption technology making electronic payments safe and secure. It's quick, easy, and much faster than mailing in a check or money order.

IRS Direct Pay is a secure service you can use to pay your taxes for Form 1040 series, estimated taxes or other associated forms directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you. Complete the five easy steps and you'll receive instant confirmation after you submit your payment. With Direct Pay, you can use the ""Look Up a Payment"" feature to view your payment details and status. You can opt in to receive email notifications about your payment. You can also modify or cancel your payment up to two business days before your scheduled payment date.

You can access your federal tax account information through a secure login at Your Online Account. You can view the amount you owe along with details of your balance, view your payment history, access Get Your Tax Record to download or print your tax records, and view key information from your current year tax return as originally filed. In addition, you can pay using your bank account or a debit card, credit card or digital wallet or apply for an online payment agreement if you need more time to pay.

If you decide to pay by mail, enclose a check or money order with a copy of your tax return or notice. Make it payable to the United States Treasury and provide your name, address, daytime phone number, taxpayer identification number, tax year, and form or notice number (for example, 2023 Form 1040) on the front of your payment.

If you can't pay in full, you should pay as much as possible to reduce the accrual of interest on your account. Please refer to Topic no. 158 for information needed to ensure proper credit of your payment. You should consider financing the full payment of your tax liability through loans, such as a home equity loan from a financial institution or a credit card. The interest rate and any applicable fees charged by a bank or credit card company may be lower than the combination of interest and penalties set by the Internal Revenue Code.

Short-term payment plans (up to 180 days)

If you can't pay in full immediately, you may qualify for additional time --up to 180 days-- to pay in full. There's no fee for this full payment; however, interest and any applicable penalties continue to accrue until your liability is paid in full. Individuals may be able to set up a short-term payment plan using the Online Payment Agreement (OPA) application or by calling us at 800-829-1040 (individuals). See telephone assistance for hours of availability.

Payment plans (Installment agreements)

If you're not able to pay your balance in full immediately or within 180 days, you may qualify for a monthly payment plan (including an installment agreement). To request a payment plan, use the OPA application, complete Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and mail it to us, or call the appropriate telephone number listed below. A payment plan allows you to make a series of monthly payments over time. The IRS offers various options for making monthly payments:

Direct debit from your bank account,

Payroll deduction from your employer,

Payment by EFTPS,

Payment by credit card or debit card via phone or Internet,

Payment via check or money order,

Payment with cash at a retail partner. For all accepted payment methods, see Payments.

The IRS charges a user fee when you enter into a payment plan; however, if you are a low-income taxpayer, this user fee is reduced and possibly waived or reimbursed when certain conditions apply. See Additional Information on Payment Plans for more details.

If you are filing a Form 1040 for the current tax year and cannot pay the balance in full:

You may request a payment plan (including an installment agreement) using the OPA application. Even if the IRS hasn't yet issued you a bill, you may establish a pre-assessed agreement by entering the balance you'll owe from your tax return. OPA is quick and has a lower user fee compared to other application methods.

Alternatively, you may submit a Form 9465 with your return. Installment agreement requests submitted through electronic filing software are processed similarly to a Form 9465; you may use OPA instead, regardless of filing method, for quicker processing and a reduced user fee.

You may also request a payment plan by calling the toll-free number on your bill, or if you don't have a bill, call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses).

Before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements. Taxpayers in an open bankruptcy proceeding aren't generally eligible. You must specify the amount you can pay and the day of the month (1st through 28th). Your payment must be received by the IRS on your due date. If you plan on mailing your payment, consider mailing time when you select a payment day. OPA will provide an immediate determination for your proposed payment plan. If you mail Form 9465, the IRS will respond to your request typically within 30 days but it may take longer during filing season.

Installment agreements by direct debit and payroll deduction enable you to make timely payments automatically and reduce the possibility of default. These convenient payment methods also allow you to avoid the time and expense of mailing monthly payments or paying electronically each month.

For a direct debit installment agreement, you must provide your checking account number, your bank routing number, and written authorization to initiate the automated withdrawal of the payment. Apply by using the OPA application, contacting us by phone or mailing us Form 9465 with your checking account number and bank routing number. Direct debit installment agreements have a lower user fee compared to other installment agreements, and the user fee may be waived or reimbursed for low-income taxpayers.

For a payroll deduction installment agreement, submit Form 2159, Payroll Deduction AgreementPDF. Your employer must complete Form 2159, as it's an agreement between you, your employer, and the IRS.

Types of payment plans (Installment agreements)

Generally, the following installment agreements allow for streamlined processing by not requiring the completion of a collection information statement or a determination to file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. See Understanding A Federal Tax Lien for more information about the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Remember, before your payment plan request can be considered, you must be current on all filing and payment requirements.

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Generally, you’re eligible for a streamlined installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an individual, in-business with income tax only, or an out of business taxpayer)

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual) and you make a payment to reduce your liability before entering the agreement or

Your assessed tax liability is $25,001 to $50,000 (for an individual or an out of business sole proprietorship) and you agree to pay by direct debit or payroll deduction.

Also, your proposed payment amount must full pay the assessed tax liability within 72 months or satisfy the tax liability in full by the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED), whichever is less. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax for more information about the CSED.

Generally, you’re eligible for an in-business trust fund express installment agreement if:

Your assessed tax liability is $25,000 or less (for an in-business taxpayer) and

Your proposed payment amount will full pay the tax liability within 24 months or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier.

You must pay by direct debit if the assessed tax liability is between $10,000 and $25,000.

You’re eligible for a guaranteed installment agreement if the tax you owe isn’t more than $10,000 (for an individual taxpayer) and:

During the past 5 years, you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) have timely filed all income tax returns and paid any income tax due, and haven’t entered into an installment agreement for the payment of income tax;

You agree to pay the full amount you owe within 3 years or by the CSED date, whichever is earlier, and to comply with the tax laws while the agreement is in effect; and

An installment agreement that will not full pay the entire balance before the CSED is called a Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA). If you propose a payment amount that will not full pay by the CSED, you will be required to complete a financial statement and provide supporting financial information for a PPIA. Also, a Notice of Federal Tax Lien determination is required. If a PPIA is approved, your agreement is subject to future reviews to determine if your financial situation has changed. You may be required to provide a new financial statement and supporting financial information during this review. The financial information you provide may result in a reduction, an increase, or no change to your monthly installment agreement amount.

Visit Additional Information on Payment Plans for more information.

Offer in compromise

An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement between you and the IRS that resolves your tax liability by payment of an agreed upon reduced amount. Before the IRS will consider an OIC, you must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, and made all required estimated tax payments for the current year. If you are a business owner with employees, you must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters. If you are in an open bankruptcy proceeding, you aren't eligible to enter into an OIC. To confirm eligibility and ensure use of the current application forms, use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier tool. Use of the tool does not guarantee offer acceptance. For additional information on OICs, refer to Topic no. 204.

Temporarily delay collection

If you can't pay any of the amount due because payment would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses, you can request that the IRS delay collection until you're able to pay. If the IRS determines that you can't pay any of your tax debt because of financial hardship, the IRS may temporarily delay collection by reporting your account as currently not collectible until your financial condition improves. Being currently not collectible does not mean the debt goes away. It means the IRS has determined you can't afford to pay the debt at this time. Prior to approving your request to delay collection, we may ask you to complete a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-FPDF, Form 433-APDF or Form 433-BPDF) and provide proof of your financial status (this may include information about your assets and your monthly income and expenses). You should know that if we do delay collecting from you, your debt continues to accrue penalties up to the maximum allowed by law and interest until the debt is paid in full. During a temporary delay, we will again review your ability to pay. The IRS may temporarily suspend certain collection actions, such as issuing a levy (refer to Topic no. 201) until your financial condition improves. However, we may still file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (refer to Topic no. 201) while your account is suspended. Please call the phone number listed below to discuss this option.

Levy prohibited and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an installment agreement is pending. An installment agreement request is often pending until the IRS reviews it and establishes an installment agreement, or rejects the request for an installment agreement, or you withdraw your request for an installment agreement. The collection period is not suspended while your installment agreement is in effect. If the requested installment agreement is rejected, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Similarly, if you default on your installment agreement payments and the IRS proposes to terminate the installment agreement, the running of the collection period is suspended for 30 days. Last, if you timely exercise your right to appeal either an installment agreement rejection or termination, the running of the collection period is suspended by the time the appeal is pending to the date the appealed decision becomes final. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax.

With certain exceptions, the IRS is generally prohibited from levying and the IRS’s time to collect is suspended or prolonged while an OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following rejection of an OIC for the taxpayer to appeal the rejection, and if an appeal is requested within the 30 days, during the period while the rejection is being considered in Appeals. Refer to Time IRS Can Collect Tax and Topic no. 204.

Responding to your IRS notice

It's important to respond to an IRS notice. If you don't pay your tax liability in full or make an alternative payment arrangement, the IRS has the right to take collection action. Refer to Topic no. 201 for information about the collection process.

If you're not able to make any payment at this time, please have your financial information available (for example, pay stubs, lease or rental agreements, mortgage statements, car lease/loan, utilities) and call us at 800-829-1040 (individuals) or 800-829-4933 (businesses) for assistance.

You have rights and protections throughout the collection process; see Taxpayer Bill of Rights and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer. If you would like information about payment arrangements, installment agreements, and what happens when you take no action to pay, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection ProcessPDF.

Injured spouse claim

If you filed a joint return and you're not responsible for debt that is subject to offset because it is owed by your spouse, you're entitled to request your portion of the refund back from the IRS. You may file a claim for this amount by filing Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation.

You may file Form 8379 in any of the following ways:

With your original joint tax return (Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR),

With your amended joint tax return (Form 1040-X) if you are claiming a joint refund, or

By itself after you receive notification of an offset.

When filing a Form 8379 by mail either with your joint return or with an amended return, write ""Injured Spouse"" in the top left corner of the first page of the joint return.

The IRS can process your Form 8379 before an offset occurs. If you file Form 8379 with your original return, it may take 11 weeks to process an electronically-filed return or 14 weeks if you filed a paper return. If you file the Form 8379 by itself after a joint return has been processed, then processing will take about 8 weeks. To avoid delays, be sure to follow the instructions for Form 8379PDF.

When filing Form 8379 by itself, you must show both spouses' taxpayer identification numbers in the same order as they appeared on your joint income tax return. You, the injured spouse, must sign the form. Follow the instructions on Form 8379 carefully and be sure to attach the required Forms W-2 and W-2G for both spouses and any Forms 1099 showing federal income tax withholding to avoid delays. Don't attach the previously filed joint tax return. Send Form 8379 to the Service Center where you filed your original return and allow at least 8 weeks for the IRS to process your request. The IRS will compute the injured spouse's share of the joint refund. If you lived in a community property state during the tax year, the IRS will divide the joint refund based upon state community property law. Not all debts are subject to a tax refund offset. To determine whether an offset will occur on a debt owed (other than federal tax), contact BFS's TOP call center at 800-304-3107 (800-877-8339 for TTY/TDD help).

"content: An offer in compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service that settles a taxpayer's tax liabilities for less than the full amount owed. Taxpayers who can fully pay the liabilities through an installment agreement or other means, generally won't qualify for an OIC in most cases. For information concerning tax payment options including installment agreements, refer to Topic no. 202. To qualify for an OIC, the taxpayer must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, made all required estimated tax payments for the current year, and if the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, the taxpayer must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters.

In most cases, the IRS won't accept an OIC unless the amount offered by a taxpayer is equal to or greater than the reasonable collection potential (RCP). The RCP is how the IRS measures the taxpayer's ability to pay. The RCP includes the value that can be realized from the taxpayer's assets, such as real property, automobiles, bank accounts, and other property. In addition to property, the RCP also includes anticipated future income less certain amounts allowed for basic living expenses.

Reasons for the offer

The IRS may accept an OIC based on one of the following reasons:"|"An offer in compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service that settles a taxpayer's tax liabilities for less than the full amount owed.

The RCP includes the value that can be realized from the taxpayer's assets, such as real property, automobiles, bank accounts, and other property. In addition to property, the RCP also includes anticipated future income less certain amounts allowed for basic living expenses.

Reasons for the offer

The IRS may accept an OIC based on one of the following reasons:

First, the IRS can accept a compromise if there is doubt as to liability . A compromise meets this criterion only when there's a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law.

. A compromise meets this criterion only when there's a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law. Second, the IRS can accept a compromise if there is doubt that the amount owed is fully collectible. Doubt as to collectibility exists in any case where the taxpayer's assets and income are less than the full amount of the tax liability.

exists in any case where the taxpayer's assets and income are less than the full amount of the tax liability. Third, the IRS can accept a compromise based on effective tax administration. An offer may be accepted based on effective tax administration when there is no doubt that the tax is legally owed and that the full amount owed can be collected, but requiring payment in full would either create an economic hardship or would be unfair and inequitable because of exceptional circumstances.

Forms to use

When submitting an OIC based on doubt as to collectibility or effective tax administration, taxpayers must use the most current version of Form 656, Offer in Compromise, and also submit Form 433-A (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, and/or Form 433-B (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Businesses. A taxpayer submitting an OIC based on doubt as to liability must file a Form 656-L, Offer in Compromise (Doubt as to Liability)PDF, instead of Form 656 and Form 433-A (OIC) and/or Form 433-B (OIC). Form 656 and referenced collection information statements are available in the Offer in Compromise Booklet, Form 656-BPDF.

Application fee

In general, a taxpayer must submit an application fee for the amount stated on Form 656. Don't combine this fee with any other tax payments. However, there are two exceptions to this requirement:

First, no application fee is required if the OIC is based on doubt as to liability.

Second, the fee isn't required if the taxpayer is an individual (not a corporation, partnership, or other entity) who qualifies for the low-income exception. There are two alternative options for qualifying. The first is that the individual's adjusted gross income, as determined for the most recent taxable year for which such information is available, falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. The second is that the household's gross monthly income x 12 months falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. For both options, section 1 of Form 656 contains the Low-Income Certification guidelines to assist taxpayers in determining whether they qualify for the low-income exception. A taxpayer who claims the low-income exception should check the appropriate certification box in the Low-Income Certification in section 1 of Form 656.

Payment options

Lump sum cash offer – Taxpayers may choose to pay the offer amount in a lump sum or in installment payments. A ""lump sum cash offer"" is defined as an offer payable in 5 or fewer installments within 5 or fewer months after the offer is accepted. If a taxpayer submits a lump sum cash offer, the taxpayer must include with the Form 656 a nonrefundable payment equal to 20 percent of the offer amount. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. The 20 percent payment is generally nonrefundable, meaning it won't be returned to the taxpayer even if the offer is rejected or returned to the taxpayer without acceptance. Instead, the 20 percent payment will be applied to the taxpayer's tax liability. The taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liability to which the IRS will apply the 20 percent payment.

Periodic payment offer – An offer is called a ""periodic payment offer"" under the tax law if it's payable in 6 or more monthly installments and within 24 months after the offer is accepted. When submitting a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must include the first proposed installment payment along with the Form 656. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. This amount is generally nonrefundable, just like the 20 percent payment required for a lump sum cash offer. Also, while the IRS is evaluating a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must continue to make the installment payments provided for under the terms of the offer. These amounts are also nonrefundable. These amounts are applied to the tax liabilities and the taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liabilities to which the periodic payments will be applied.

Upon acceptance of an OIC, the taxpayer may no longer designate offer payments to any tax liability specifically covered in the offer agreement.

Suspension of collection

Ordinarily, the statutory time within which the IRS may engage in collection activities is suspended during the period that the OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following the IRS's rejection of an OIC, and for the period in which a timely appealed rejection is being considered by the IRS Independent Office of Appeals.

Offer terms

If the IRS accepts the taxpayer's offer, the taxpayer will have agreed to fully comply with the tax laws. The IRS will keep any refund, including interest, that might be due for tax returns filed through the date the IRS accepts the offer. If the taxpayer doesn't abide by all the terms and conditions of the OIC, the IRS may determine that the OIC is in default. For doubt as to collectibility and effective tax administration OICs, the terms and conditions include a requirement that the taxpayer timely file all tax returns and timely pay all taxes for 5 years from the date of acceptance of the OIC. When the IRS terminates an OIC, the agreement is no longer in effect and the IRS may then collect the amounts originally owed (less payments made), plus interest and penalties.

Right to appeal

If the IRS rejects an OIC, the taxpayer will be notified by mail. The letter will explain the reason that the IRS rejected the offer and will provide detailed instructions on how the taxpayer may appeal the decision to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. The appeal must be made within 30 days from the date of the letter.

Return of an offer

In some cases, an OIC is returned to the taxpayer rather than rejected, because the taxpayer didn't submit necessary information, filed for bankruptcy, failed to include a required application fee or nonrefundable payment with the offer, hasn't filed required tax returns, or hasn't paid current tax liabilities at the time the IRS is considering the offer. A returned offer is different from a rejection because there's no right to appeal when the IRS returns the offer. However, once cured, the offer may be submitted again.

"Reasons for the offer

The IRS may accept an OIC based on one of the following reasons:

First, the IRS can accept a compromise if there is doubt as to liability . A compromise meets this criterion only when there's a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law.

An offer may be accepted based on effective tax administration when there is no doubt that the tax is legally owed and that the full amount owed can be collected, but requiring payment in full would either create an economic hardship or would be unfair and inequitable because of exceptional circumstances.

Forms to use"|"An offer in compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service that settles a taxpayer's tax liabilities for less than the full amount owed. Taxpayers who can fully pay the liabilities through an installment agreement or other means, generally won't qualify for an OIC in most cases. For information concerning tax payment options including installment agreements, refer to Topic no. 202. To qualify for an OIC, the taxpayer must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, made all required estimated tax payments for the current year, and if the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, the taxpayer must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters.

In most cases, the IRS won't accept an OIC unless the amount offered by a taxpayer is equal to or greater than the reasonable collection potential (RCP). The RCP is how the IRS measures the taxpayer's ability to pay. The RCP includes the value that can be realized from the taxpayer's assets, such as real property, automobiles, bank accounts, and other property. In addition to property, the RCP also includes anticipated future income less certain amounts allowed for basic living expenses.

Forms to use

When submitting an OIC based on doubt as to collectibility or effective tax administration, taxpayers must use the most current version of Form 656, Offer in Compromise, and also submit Form 433-A (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, and/or Form 433-B (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Businesses. A taxpayer submitting an OIC based on doubt as to liability must file a Form 656-L, Offer in Compromise (Doubt as to Liability)PDF, instead of Form 656 and Form 433-A (OIC) and/or Form 433-B (OIC). Form 656 and referenced collection information statements are available in the Offer in Compromise Booklet, Form 656-BPDF.

Application fee

In general, a taxpayer must submit an application fee for the amount stated on Form 656. Don't combine this fee with any other tax payments. However, there are two exceptions to this requirement:

First, no application fee is required if the OIC is based on doubt as to liability.

Second, the fee isn't required if the taxpayer is an individual (not a corporation, partnership, or other entity) who qualifies for the low-income exception. There are two alternative options for qualifying. The first is that the individual's adjusted gross income, as determined for the most recent taxable year for which such information is available, falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. The second is that the household's gross monthly income x 12 months falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. For both options, section 1 of Form 656 contains the Low-Income Certification guidelines to assist taxpayers in determining whether they qualify for the low-income exception. A taxpayer who claims the low-income exception should check the appropriate certification box in the Low-Income Certification in section 1 of Form 656.

Payment options

Lump sum cash offer – Taxpayers may choose to pay the offer amount in a lump sum or in installment payments. A ""lump sum cash offer"" is defined as an offer payable in 5 or fewer installments within 5 or fewer months after the offer is accepted. If a taxpayer submits a lump sum cash offer, the taxpayer must include with the Form 656 a nonrefundable payment equal to 20 percent of the offer amount. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. The 20 percent payment is generally nonrefundable, meaning it won't be returned to the taxpayer even if the offer is rejected or returned to the taxpayer without acceptance. Instead, the 20 percent payment will be applied to the taxpayer's tax liability. The taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liability to which the IRS will apply the 20 percent payment.

Periodic payment offer – An offer is called a ""periodic payment offer"" under the tax law if it's payable in 6 or more monthly installments and within 24 months after the offer is accepted. When submitting a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must include the first proposed installment payment along with the Form 656. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. This amount is generally nonrefundable, just like the 20 percent payment required for a lump sum cash offer. Also, while the IRS is evaluating a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must continue to make the installment payments provided for under the terms of the offer. These amounts are also nonrefundable. These amounts are applied to the tax liabilities and the taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liabilities to which the periodic payments will be applied.

Upon acceptance of an OIC, the taxpayer may no longer designate offer payments to any tax liability specifically covered in the offer agreement.

Suspension of collection

Ordinarily, the statutory time within which the IRS may engage in collection activities is suspended during the period that the OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following the IRS's rejection of an OIC, and for the period in which a timely appealed rejection is being considered by the IRS Independent Office of Appeals.

Offer terms

If the IRS accepts the taxpayer's offer, the taxpayer will have agreed to fully comply with the tax laws. The IRS will keep any refund, including interest, that might be due for tax returns filed through the date the IRS accepts the offer. If the taxpayer doesn't abide by all the terms and conditions of the OIC, the IRS may determine that the OIC is in default. For doubt as to collectibility and effective tax administration OICs, the terms and conditions include a requirement that the taxpayer timely file all tax returns and timely pay all taxes for 5 years from the date of acceptance of the OIC. When the IRS terminates an OIC, the agreement is no longer in effect and the IRS may then collect the amounts originally owed (less payments made), plus interest and penalties.

Right to appeal

If the IRS rejects an OIC, the taxpayer will be notified by mail. The letter will explain the reason that the IRS rejected the offer and will provide detailed instructions on how the taxpayer may appeal the decision to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. The appeal must be made within 30 days from the date of the letter.

Return of an offer

In some cases, an OIC is returned to the taxpayer rather than rejected, because the taxpayer didn't submit necessary information, filed for bankruptcy, failed to include a required application fee or nonrefundable payment with the offer, hasn't filed required tax returns, or hasn't paid current tax liabilities at the time the IRS is considering the offer.

For both options, section 1 of Form 656 contains the Low-Income Certification guidelines to assist taxpayers in determining whether they qualify for the low-income exception. A taxpayer who claims the low-income exception should check the appropriate certification box in the Low-Income Certification in section 1 of Form 656.

Payment options

Lump sum cash offer – Taxpayers may choose to pay the offer amount in a lump sum or in installment payments. A ""lump sum cash offer"" is defined as an offer payable in 5 or fewer installments within 5 or fewer months after the offer is accepted. If a taxpayer submits a lump sum cash offer, the taxpayer must include with the Form 656 a nonrefundable payment equal to 20 percent of the offer amount. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. The 20 percent payment is generally nonrefundable, meaning it won't be returned to the taxpayer even if the offer is rejected or returned to the taxpayer without acceptance. Instead, the 20 percent payment will be applied to the taxpayer's tax liability. The taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liability to which the IRS will apply the 20 percent payment.

Periodic payment offer – An offer is called a ""periodic payment offer"" under the tax law if it's payable in 6 or more monthly installments and within 24 months after the offer is accepted. When submitting a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must include the first proposed installment payment along with the Form 656. This payment is required in addition to the application fee. This amount is generally nonrefundable, just like the 20 percent payment required for a lump sum cash offer. Also, while the IRS is evaluating a periodic payment offer, the taxpayer must continue to make the installment payments provided for under the terms of the offer. These amounts are also nonrefundable. These amounts are applied to the tax liabilities and the taxpayer has a right to specify the particular tax liabilities to which the periodic payments will be applied.

Upon acceptance of an OIC, the taxpayer may no longer designate offer payments to any tax liability specifically covered in the offer agreement.

Suspension of collection

Ordinarily, the statutory time within which the IRS may engage in collection activities is suspended during the period that the OIC is pending, for 30 days immediately following the IRS's rejection of an OIC, and for the period in which a timely appealed rejection is being considered by the IRS Independent Office of Appeals.

Offer terms

If the IRS accepts the taxpayer's offer, the taxpayer will have agreed to fully comply with the tax laws. The IRS will keep any refund, including interest, that might be due for tax returns filed through the date the IRS accepts the offer. If the taxpayer doesn't abide by all the terms and conditions of the OIC, the IRS may determine that the OIC is in default. For doubt as to collectibility and effective tax administration OICs, the terms and conditions include a requirement that the taxpayer timely file all tax returns and timely pay all taxes for 5 years from the date of acceptance of the OIC. When the IRS terminates an OIC, the agreement is no longer in effect and the IRS may then collect the amounts originally owed (less payments made), plus interest and penalties.

Right to appeal

If the IRS rejects an OIC, the taxpayer will be notified by mail. The letter will explain the reason that the IRS rejected the offer and will provide detailed instructions on how the taxpayer may appeal the decision to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals. The appeal must be made within 30 days from the date of the letter.

Return of an offer

In some cases, an OIC is returned to the taxpayer rather than rejected, because the taxpayer didn't submit necessary information, filed for bankruptcy, failed to include a required application fee or nonrefundable payment with the offer, hasn't filed required tax returns, or hasn't paid current tax liabilities at the time the IRS is considering the offer. A returned offer is different from a rejection because there's no right to appeal when the IRS returns the offer. However, once cured, the offer may be submitted again.

Offer terms"|"An offer in compromise (OIC) is an agreement between a taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service that settles a taxpayer's tax liabilities for less than the full amount owed. Taxpayers who can fully pay the liabilities through an installment agreement or other means, generally won't qualify for an OIC in most cases. For information concerning tax payment options including installment agreements, refer to Topic no. 202. To qualify for an OIC, the taxpayer must have filed all tax returns, have received a bill for at least one tax debt included on the offer, made all required estimated tax payments for the current year, and if the taxpayer is a business owner with employees, the taxpayer must have made all required federal tax deposits for the current quarter and the two preceding quarters.

In most cases, the IRS won't accept an OIC unless the amount offered by a taxpayer is equal to or greater than the reasonable collection potential (RCP). The RCP is how the IRS measures the taxpayer's ability to pay. The RCP includes the value that can be realized from the taxpayer's assets, such as real property, automobiles, bank accounts, and other property. In addition to property, the RCP also includes anticipated future income less certain amounts allowed for basic living expenses.

Reasons for the offer

The IRS may accept an OIC based on one of the following reasons:

First, the IRS can accept a compromise if there is doubt as to liability . A compromise meets this criterion only when there's a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law.

. A compromise meets this criterion only when there's a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law. Second, the IRS can accept a compromise if there is doubt that the amount owed is fully collectible. Doubt as to collectibility exists in any case where the taxpayer's assets and income are less than the full amount of the tax liability.

exists in any case where the taxpayer's assets and income are less than the full amount of the tax liability. Third, the IRS can accept a compromise based on effective tax administration. An offer may be accepted based on effective tax administration when there is no doubt that the tax is legally owed and that the full amount owed can be collected, but requiring payment in full would either create an economic hardship or would be unfair and inequitable because of exceptional circumstances.

Forms to use

When submitting an OIC based on doubt as to collectibility or effective tax administration, taxpayers must use the most current version of Form 656, Offer in Compromise, and also submit Form 433-A (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, and/or Form 433-B (OIC), Collection Information Statement for Businesses. A taxpayer submitting an OIC based on doubt as to liability must file a Form 656-L, Offer in Compromise (Doubt as to Liability)PDF, instead of Form 656 and Form 433-A (OIC) and/or Form 433-B (OIC). Form 656 and referenced collection information statements are available in the Offer in Compromise Booklet, Form 656-BPDF.

Application fee

In general, a taxpayer must submit an application fee for the amount stated on Form 656. Don't combine this fee with any other tax payments. However, there are two exceptions to this requirement:

First, no application fee is required if the OIC is based on doubt as to liability.

Second, the fee isn't required if the taxpayer is an individual (not a corporation, partnership, or other entity) who qualifies for the low-income exception. There are two alternative options for qualifying. The first is that the individual's adjusted gross income, as determined for the most recent taxable year for which such information is available, falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. The second is that the household's gross monthly income x 12 months falls at or below 250 percent of the poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. For both options, section 1 of Form 656 contains the Low-Income Certification guidelines to assist taxpayers in determining whether they qualify for the low-income exception. A taxpayer who claims the low-income exception should check the appropriate certification box in the Low-Income Certification in section 1 of Form 656.

"content: Responding to taxpayer inquiries:

My check (payment) didn't clear. What now?

At times, taxpayers will call the IRS because they received a Letter 608C, Dishonored Check Penalty Explained, stating that their payment was dishonored and returned from a financial institution unpaid. When this letter is sent out to the taxpayer, the check is determined to be unpaid and the IRS won't resubmit it for payment. The IRS doesn't resubmit checks or other commercial payment instruments a second time for payment.

When a check or other commercial payment instrument isn't paid, however, the clearinghouse does frequently resubmit it to the bank.

The clearinghouse, not the IRS, determines whether or not to resubmit a payment so the IRS doesn't know if the payment instrument will be submitted a second time or not by the clearinghouse. It's up to you to decide whether to wait and see if the clearinghouse resubmits it to the bank, or whether you should make an additional payment.

If your check or other commercial payment instrument is resubmitted and there are sufficient funds in your bank account to cover it, the check will be paid and not returned to the IRS, so you won't be charged the dishonored check penalty. If the payment is honored after the due date, however, you may be charged interest and a penalty for the late payment. We'll notify you if a balance becomes due on your account.

How is the penalty calculated?"|"Responding to taxpayer inquiries:

My check (payment) didn't clear. What now?

At times, taxpayers will call the IRS because they received a Letter 608C, Dishonored Check Penalty Explained, stating that their payment was dishonored and returned from a financial institution unpaid. When this letter is sent out to the taxpayer, the check is determined to be unpaid and the IRS won't resubmit it for payment. The IRS doesn't resubmit checks or other commercial payment instruments a second time for payment.

When a check or other commercial payment instrument isn't paid, however, the clearinghouse does frequently resubmit it to the bank.

The clearinghouse, not the IRS, determines whether or not to resubmit a payment so the IRS doesn't know if the payment instrument will be submitted a second time or not by the clearinghouse. It's up to you to decide whether to wait and see if the clearinghouse resubmits it to the bank, or whether you should make an additional payment.

If your check or other commercial payment instrument is resubmitted and there are sufficient funds in your bank account to cover it, the check will be paid and not returned to the IRS, so you won't be charged the dishonored check penalty. If the payment is honored after the due date, however, you may be charged interest and a penalty for the late payment. We'll notify you if a balance becomes due on your account.

How is the penalty calculated?

When a check or other commercial payment instrument the IRS receives for payment of taxes doesn't clear the bank, a penalty of 2 percent of the amount of the check or other commercial payment instrument generally applies. However, if the amount of the check or other commercial payment instrument is less than $1,250, the penalty is $25 or the amount of the check or other commercial payment instrument, whichever is less. Thus, if the amount of the check or other commercial payment instrument is between $25 and $1,250, the penalty is $25.

Requesting penalty abatement

The IRS can abate (remove) this penalty in certain circumstances. You may request penalty abatement by providing an explanation or evidence that it was reasonable to expect that the payment would be honored. You must make this request in writing and should only do it after you've received the Letter 608C notifying you of a penalty assessment.

Stop payments

A dishonored check penalty isn't assessed on checks or other payment instruments for which you placed a stop payment order. If you're assessed a penalty, please send a copy of the stop payment request along with your penalty relief request to the service center address listed on your Letter 608C."|20|collection|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc206|3bdd1ff43b0c449cb88765038d2494cc

You can designate your paid tax return preparer or another third-party to speak to the IRS concerning the preparation of your return, payment/refund issues, and mathematical errors. The third-party authorization checkbox on IRS tax forms gives the designated party the authority to receive and inspect returns and return information and to discuss the processing of your current tax return, including the status of refunds for one year from the original due date of your return (without regard to extensions).

Steps you should take to find a tax return preparer

Most tax return preparers are professional, honest, and provide excellent service to their clients. However, dishonest and unscrupulous tax return preparers who file false income tax returns do exist. See Make a Complaint About a Tax Return Preparer if you have been financially impacted by a tax return preparer's misconduct or improper tax preparation practices. You should always check your return for errors to avoid potential financial and legal problems.

Free tax preparation

The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) is an IRS-sponsored program that provides free tax filing assistance using IRS-certified volunteers. The VITA program offers free tax help to individuals with low-to-moderate income, persons with disabilities, elderly and limited English-speaking taxpayers. VITA also offers access to free tax preparation software for those who are able to prepare their own tax returns. If your return is determined to be out of scope by the VITA site, you will be referred to seek a paid tax preparer.

You can locate a VITA or Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) site near you by visiting the site locator tool.

The following points will assist you when selecting a tax return preparer:

Be wary of tax return preparers who claim they can obtain larger refunds than others can.

Avoid tax return preparers who base their fees on a percentage of the refund or who offer to deposit all or part of your refund into their financial accounts.

Ensure you use a preparer with a PTIN. Paid tax return preparers must have a PTIN to prepare all or substantially all of a tax return.

Use a reputable tax professional who enters his or her PTIN on the tax return, signs the tax return, and provides you a copy of the return (as required).

Consider whether the individual or firm will be around for months or years after filing the return to answer questions about the preparation of the tax return.

Never sign a blank tax form.

Good preparers will ask to see your records and receipts. They'll also ask questions to figure things like the total income, tax deductions and credits.

Check the preparer’s history. Taxpayers can ask the local Better Business Bureau about the preparer.

Check the person's credentials. Only attorneys, CPAs, and enrolled agents can represent taxpayers before the IRS in all matters, including audits, collections, and appeals. Other tax return preparers who participate in the IRS Annual Filing Season Program have limited practice rights to represent taxpayers for audits of returns they prepared and signed. See Annual Filing Season Program for more information.

Generally, you may e-file your tax return even if you're required to submit certain paper forms or supporting documents. Use Form 8453, U.S. Individual Income Tax Transmittal for an IRS e-file Return to transmit required paper forms or supporting paper documents.

The IRS advises keeping a copy of your tax return and Form 8879 for your records. It may assist with electronically signing your next year's e-file return. If you need a copy or a transcript of your return, refer to Topic no. 156 for assistance."|23|alternative filing methods|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc255|eb4bdd7d4d93406aa9b0971f1b96159b
"content: When to file

If you're a calendar year filer and your tax year ends on December 31, the due date for filing your federal individual income tax return is generally April 15 of each year. If you use a fiscal year (tax year ending on the last day of any month other than December), your return is due on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the close of your fiscal year. If your due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is moved to the next business day. For the 2023 tax return, the due date for most filers is April 15, 2024 (April 17, 2024, if you live in Maine or Massachusetts).

Your return is considered filed on time if the envelope is properly addressed, has enough postage, is postmarked, and is deposited in the mail by the due date. If you file electronically, the date and time in your time zone when your return is transmitted controls whether your return is filed timely. You will later receive an electronic acknowledgement that the IRS has accepted your electronically filed return."|"When to file

You generally have at least 180 days after you leave the designated combat zone/contingency operation to file and pay taxes. See Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide. If the Service determines you to be affected by a federally declared disaster, a significant fire or a terroristic or military action, you may have up to one year after the due date of your return to file and pay taxes, depending on the deadline specified by the Service.

To receive an automatic 6-month extension of time to file your return, you can file Form 4868. File your extension request by the due date of your return. An extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay so you'll owe interest if the tax you owe isn't paid by the original due date of your return. You may also be subject to a late-payment penalty on any tax not paid by the original due date of your return.

Where to file"|"When to file

If you're a calendar year filer and your tax year ends on December 31, the due date for filing your federal individual income tax return is generally April 15 of each year. If you use a fiscal year (tax year ending on the last day of any month other than December), your return is due on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the close of your fiscal year. If your due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is moved to the next business day. For the 2023 tax return, the due date for most filers is April 15, 2024 (April 17, 2024, if you live in Maine or Massachusetts).

Your return is considered filed on time if the envelope is properly addressed, has enough postage, is postmarked, and is deposited in the mail by the due date. If you file electronically, the date and time in your time zone when your return is transmitted controls whether your return is filed timely. You will later receive an electronic acknowledgement that the IRS has accepted your electronically filed return.

If you served or are serving in the Armed Forces in a combat zone or a contingency operation, or become hospitalized as the result of an injury received while serving in such an area or operation, after the end of your tax year but before the normal filing due date of your return, you may have additional time to file and pay taxes. You generally have at least 180 days after you leave the designated combat zone/contingency operation to file and pay taxes. See Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide. If the Service determines you to be affected by a federally declared disaster, a significant fire or a terroristic or military action, you may have up to one year after the due date of your return to file and pay taxes, depending on the deadline specified by the Service. If you're living and working outside the United States and Puerto Rico or in the military or naval service on duty outside the United States and Puerto Rico, you may qualify for an automatic 2-month extension to file and pay the tax without filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You will be charged interest on any amount not paid by the regular due date until the date the tax is paid. Please refer to “What if You Can’t File on Time?” in the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) and the instructions in Form 4868.

Extensions to file - If you cannot file by the due date of your return, you should request an extension of time to file. To receive an automatic 6-month extension of time to file your return, you can file Form 4868. File your extension request by the due date of your return. An extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay so you'll owe interest if the tax you owe isn't paid by the original due date of your return. You may also be subject to a late-payment penalty on any tax not paid by the original due date of your return. For more information about extensions, see Extension of Time to File, What is the due date of my federal tax return or am I eligible to request an extension? and Topic no. 304.

How to file

You may want to file your return electronically. You'll usually receive your refund within 3 weeks of the date when the IRS receives your return, even faster if you elect to have it directly deposited into your checking or savings account. Most professional tax return preparers offer electronic filing of tax returns with their return preparation services and may charge a fee to file your return electronically. Also, when you prepare your return yourself using tax-preparation software, you may have to pay a fee to file your return electronically. However, you may qualify for free electronic filing through Free File. For more information on electronic filing in general, visit Electronic filing options for individuals.

You'll still have to pay interest on any tax not paid by the regular due date of your return. You can also receive an additional 4-month extension of time to file (or, a total of six months) if you file Form 4868 and check the box on line 8 to indicate that you need an additional 4 months to file your return. The additional 4-month period is not an extension of time to pay.

Additional resources"|"You may request up to an additional 6 months to file your U.S. individual income tax return. There are three ways to request an automatic extension of time to file your return. You must request the extension of time to file by the regular due date of your return to avoid the penalty for filing late. An extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay. You may file your extension in any one of three ways listed below:

If you file the Form 4868 electronically, be sure to have a copy of your prior year's return; you'll be asked to provide your prior year's adjusted gross income (AGI) amount for verification purposes. Once you file, you'll receive an electronic acknowledgement that the IRS has accepted your filing. Keep this for your records. You should refer to your tax software or tax professional for ways to file and pay electronically using e-file services. Several companies offer free filing of Form 4868 through the Free File program.

Out of the country – You're allowed two extra months (generally until June 15) to file your return and pay any tax due without requesting an extension if you're a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and on the regular due date of your return you're either:

Living outside of the United States and Puerto Rico, and your main place of business or post of duty is outside of the United States and Puerto Rico, or In military or naval service on duty outside of the United States and Puerto Rico.

You must keep records, such as receipts, canceled checks, and other documents that support an item of income, a deduction, or a credit appearing on a return as long as they may become material in the administration of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code, which generally will be until the period of limitations expires for that return.

Period of limitations for assessment of tax:

3 years - For assessment of tax you owe, this period is generally 3 years from the date you filed the return. Returns filed before the due date are treated as filed on the due date.

No limit - There's no period of limitations to assess tax when you file a fraudulent return or when you don't file a return.

6 years - If you don't report income that you should have reported, and it's more than 25% of the gross income shown on the return, or it’s attributable to foreign financial assets and is more than $5,000, the time to assess tax is 6 years from the date you filed the return.

Period of limitations for refund claims:

The later of 3 years or 2 years after tax was paid - For filing a claim for credit or refund, the period to make the claim generally is 3 years from the date you filed the original return (or the due date for filing the return if you filed the return before that date) or 2 years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later.

7 years - For filing a claim for an overpayment resulting from a bad debt deduction or a loss from worthless securities, the time to make the claim is 7 years from when the return was due.

Property records

Keep records relating to property until the period of limitations expires for the year in which you dispose of the property in a taxable disposition. You must keep these records to figure your basis for computing gain or loss when you sell or otherwise dispose of the property.

Healthcare insurance

You should keep records of your own and your family members' health care insurance coverage. If you're claiming the premium tax credit, you'll need information about any advance credit payments you received through the Health Insurance Marketplace and the premiums you paid.

Business income and expenses

If you're in business, there's not a required method of bookkeeping you must use. However, you must use a method that clearly and accurately reflects your gross income and expenses. The records should substantiate both your income and expenses. If you have employees, you must keep all your employment tax records for at least 4 years after the tax becomes due or is paid, whichever is later.

"content: The United States income tax system is a pay-as-you-go tax system, which means that you must pay income tax as you earn or receive your income during the year. You can do this either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments. If you didn't pay enough tax throughout the year, either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments, you may have to pay a penalty for underpayment of estimated tax. Generally, most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they either owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholding and refundable credits, or if they paid withholding and estimated tax of at least 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever is smaller. There are special rules for farmers and fishermen, certain household employers and certain higher income taxpayers. For more information, refer to Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals.

Generally, taxpayers should make estimated tax payments in four equal amounts to avoid a penalty. However, if you receive income unevenly during the year, you may be able to vary the amounts of the payments to avoid or lower the penalty by using the annualized installment method. Use Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts to see if you owe a penalty for underpaying your estimated tax.

When you open a new account, make an investment, or begin to receive payments reportable on Form 1099, you must provide your TIN. For certain types of payments, you must provide the TIN in writing and certify under penalties of perjury that it's correct. In those cases, the bank or business will give you Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification or a similar form.

You fail to certify that you're not subject to backup withholding for underreporting of interest and dividends.

How to prevent or stop backup withholding

To stop backup withholding, you'll need to correct the reason you became subject to backup withholding in the first place. This can include providing the correct TIN to the payer, resolving the underreported income and paying the amount owed, or filing the missing return(s), as appropriate.

If you receive a notice from a payer notifying you that the TIN you gave is incorrect, you can usually prevent backup withholding from starting or stop it once it has begun by giving the payer your correct name and TIN and certifying that the TIN you give is correct. If you receive a second notice from that payer, you'll need to provide verification of your correct name and TIN. Refer to Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TIN(s)PDF for more details.

Credit for backup withholding

If your Form 1099 shows an amount withheld under the backup withholding rules, report the amount as federal income tax withheld on your income tax return for the year you received the income.

If you operate as a partnership or subchapter S corporation, any backup withholding can only be claimed by the partners and shareholders.

Backup withholding can apply to most kinds of payments reported on Form 1099, including:

Withholding rules

When you open a new account, make an investment, or begin to receive payments reportable on Form 1099, you must provide your TIN. For certain types of payments, you must provide the TIN in writing and certify under penalties of perjury that it's correct. In those cases, the bank or business will give you Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification or a similar form. If your account or investment will earn interest or dividends, you must also certify that you're not subject to backup withholding due to previous underreporting of interest and dividends.

You may be subject to backup withholding and the payer must withhold at a flat 24% rate when:

You don't give the payer your TIN in the required manner.

The IRS notifies the payer that the TIN you gave is incorrect.

The IRS notifies the payer to start withholding on interest or dividends because you have underreported interest or dividends on your income tax return. The IRS will do this only after it has mailed you four notices over at least a 120-day period.

You fail to certify that you're not subject to backup withholding for underreporting of interest and dividends.

How to prevent or stop backup withholding

To stop backup withholding, you'll need to correct the reason you became subject to backup withholding in the first place. This can include providing the correct TIN to the payer, resolving the underreported income and paying the amount owed, or filing the missing return(s), as appropriate.

If you receive a notice from a payer notifying you that the TIN you gave is incorrect, you can usually prevent backup withholding from starting or stop it once it has begun by giving the payer your correct name and TIN and certifying that the TIN you give is correct. If you receive a second notice from that payer, you'll need to provide verification of your correct name and TIN. Refer to Publication 1281, Backup Withholding for Missing and Incorrect Name/TIN(s)PDF for more details.

Credit for backup withholding

If your Form 1099 shows an amount withheld under the backup withholding rules, report the amount as federal income tax withheld on your income tax return for the year you received the income.

If you operate as a partnership or subchapter S corporation, any backup withholding can only be claimed by the partners and shareholders. Partners and shareholders should report their respective shares of the withheld amounts on their individual income tax returns. The amounts aren't refundable to the partnership or subchapter S corporation.

You can find more information on backup withholding in Publication 1335, Underreporter Backup Withholding Questions and AnswersPDF, Backup Withholding and Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax."|29|general information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc307|c2ce971d78b04d768d95e3ab2a66992c

Balance due

If you owe additional tax, and the due date for filing that tax return hasn't passed, you can avoid penalties and interest if you file Form 1040-X or a corrected return (Form 1040) and pay the tax by the filing due date for that year (without regard to any extension of time to file). This return will replace or supersede the original return. If the filing due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, your superseded return is timely if filed or paid the next business day. If you file after the due date, don't include any interest or penalties on Form 1040-X; they will be adjusted accordingly.

When to file

Generally, to claim a refund, you must file Form 1040-X within 3 years after the date you filed your original return or within 2 years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. Returns filed before the due date (without regard to extensions) are considered filed on the due date, and withholding is deemed to be tax paid on the due date. Special rules apply for refund claims relating to net operating losses, foreign tax credits, bad debts, and other issues. For more information, refer to the Instructions for Form 1040-X.

Tax information authorization

You can use Form 8821 to allow the IRS to discuss your tax matters with designated third parties and, where necessary, to disclose your confidential tax return information to those designated third parties on matters other than just the processing of your current tax return. For example, this authorization allows a person you designate to access tax information needed for a background check or for applying for a loan. You cannot, however, use Form 8821 to authorize an individual to represent you before the IRS. For information on how to designate someone to represent you before the IRS, refer to Topic no. 311 and Publication 947.

Oral authorization

In certain circumstances, the IRS can accept oral authorization from taxpayers to discuss their confidential tax return information with third parties. For example, if you bring another person with you, such as your return preparer, to an interview with the IRS or involve another person in a telephone conversation with the IRS, the IRS can disclose your confidential tax return information to that third party after confirming your identity and the identity of the third party, as well as confirming with you the issues or matters to be discussed and what confidential tax return information the IRS may disclose in order to enable the third party to assist you. An oral authorization is limited to the conversation in which the taxpayer provides the authorization. Unless it is stated otherwise, the oral authorization is automatically revoked once the conversation has ended. The IRS cannot subsequently discuss your confidential tax return information with any third party until it receives a new authorization from you.

Eligible educational institutions can also establish and maintain QTPs but only to allow prepaying a beneficiary's qualified higher education expenses. Qualified higher education expenses generally include expenses required for the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at any college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the Department of Education. In addition, for purposes of QTPs, qualified higher education expenses include tuition expenses in connection with a designated beneficiary's enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school, i.e., kindergarten through grade 12, up to a total amount of $10,000 per year from all of the designated beneficiary's QTPs.

Refer to Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax (For Individuals) and How do I file a deceased person's tax return? for more information.

Income to include

The method of accounting used by the decedent at the time of death determines the income to include and the deductions to take on the final return. Most individuals use the cash receipts and disbursements method. Under this method, the final individual return should show only the items of income the decedent actually or constructively received, that were credited to the decedent’s account, or that were made available to the decedent without restriction before death. Generally, the final individual return can claim deductions for expenses the decedent paid before death. If the decedent used an accrual method, refer to Publication 559 and Publication 538, Accounting Periods and Methods for more information.

"content: Dividends are distributions of property a corporation may pay you if you own stock in that corporation. Corporations pay most dividends in cash. However, they may also pay them as stock of another corporation or as any other property. You also may receive distributions through your interest in a partnership, an estate, a trust, a subchapter S corporation, or from an association that's taxable as a corporation. A shareholder of a corporation may be deemed to receive a dividend if the corporation pays the debt of its shareholder, the shareholder receives services from the corporation, or the shareholder is allowed the use of the corporation's property without adequate reimbursement to the corporation. Additionally, a shareholder that provides services to a corporation may be deemed to receive a dividend if the corporation pays the shareholder service-provider in excess of what it would pay a third party for the same services. A shareholder may also receive distributions such as additional stock or stock rights in the distributing corporation; such distributions may or may not qualify as dividends.

A shareholder may also receive distributions such as additional stock or stock rights in the distributing corporation; such distributions may or may not qualify as dividends.

Form 1099-DIV

You should receive a Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions from each payer for distributions of at least $10. If you're a partner in a partnership or a beneficiary of an estate or trust, you may be required to report your share of any dividends received by the entity, whether or not the dividend is paid out to you. Your share of the entity's dividends is generally reported to you on a Schedule K-1.

Dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation. They're paid out of the earnings and profits of the corporation. Dividends can be classified either as ordinary or qualified. Whereas ordinary dividends are taxable as ordinary income, qualified dividends that meet certain requirements are taxed at lower capital gain rates. The payer of the dividend is required to correctly identify each type and amount of dividend for you when reporting them on your Form 1099-DIV for tax purposes. For a definition of qualified dividends, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.

Return of capital

Distributions that qualify as a return of capital aren't dividends. A return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company. A return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis of your stock. For information on basis of assets, refer to Topic no. 703. A distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution doesn't have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits. Once the adjusted cost basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, any further nondividend distribution is a taxable capital gain that you report on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses.

Capital gain distributions

Regulated investment companies (RICs) (mutual funds, exchange traded funds, money market funds, etc.) and real estate investment trusts (REITs) may pay capital gain distributions. Capital gain distributions are always reported as long-term capital gains. You must also report any undistributed capital gain that RICs or REITs have designated to you in a written notice. They report these undistributed capital gains to you on Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains. For information on how to report qualifying dividends and capital gain distributions, refer to the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR).

Additional considerations

Form 1099-DIV should break down the distribution into the various categories. If it doesn't, contact the payer.

You must give your correct social security number to the payer of your dividend income. If you don't, you may be subject to a penalty and/or backup withholding. For more information on backup withholding, refer to Topic no. 307.

If you receive over $1,500 of taxable ordinary dividends, you must report these dividends on Schedule B (Form 1040), Interest and Ordinary Dividends.

If you receive dividends in significant amounts, you may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) and may have to pay estimated tax to avoid a penalty. For more information, see Topic 559, Net Investment Income Tax, Estimated Taxes or Am I required to make estimated tax payments?

If you receive dividends in significant amounts, you may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) and may have to pay estimated tax to avoid a penalty. For more information, see Topic 559, Net Investment Income Tax, Estimated Taxes or Am I required to make estimated tax payments?

Additional information

You may find more information on dividend income in Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses."|"Dividends are distributions of property a corporation may pay you if you own stock in that corporation. Corporations pay most dividends in cash. However, they may also pay them as stock of another corporation or as any other property. You also may receive distributions through your interest in a partnership, an estate, a trust, a subchapter S corporation, or from an association that's taxable as a corporation. A shareholder of a corporation may be deemed to receive a dividend if the corporation pays the debt of its shareholder, the shareholder receives services from the corporation, or the shareholder is allowed the use of the corporation's property without adequate reimbursement to the corporation. Additionally, a shareholder that provides services to a corporation may be deemed to receive a dividend if the corporation pays the shareholder service-provider in excess of what it would pay a third party for the same services. A shareholder may also receive distributions such as additional stock or stock rights in the distributing corporation; such distributions may or may not qualify as dividends.

Form 1099-DIV

You should receive a Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions from each payer for distributions of at least $10. If you're a partner in a partnership or a beneficiary of an estate or trust, you may be required to report your share of any dividends received by the entity, whether or not the dividend is paid out to you. Your share of the entity's dividends is generally reported to you on a Schedule K-1.

Dividends are the most common type of distribution from a corporation. They're paid out of the earnings and profits of the corporation. Dividends can be classified either as ordinary or qualified. Whereas ordinary dividends are taxable as ordinary income, qualified dividends that meet certain requirements are taxed at lower capital gain rates. The payer of the dividend is required to correctly identify each type and amount of dividend for you when reporting them on your Form 1099-DIV for tax purposes. For a definition of qualified dividends, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.

Return of capital

Distributions that qualify as a return of capital aren't dividends. A return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company. A return of capital reduces the adjusted cost basis of your stock. For information on basis of assets, refer to Topic no. 703. A distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution doesn't have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits. Once the adjusted cost basis of your stock has been reduced to zero, any further nondividend distribution is a taxable capital gain that you report on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses.

Capital gain distributions

Regulated investment companies (RICs) (mutual funds, exchange traded funds, money market funds, etc.) and real estate investment trusts (REITs) may pay capital gain distributions. Capital gain distributions are always reported as long-term capital gains. You must also report any undistributed capital gain that RICs or REITs have designated to you in a written notice. They report these undistributed capital gains to you on Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains. For information on how to report qualifying dividends and capital gain distributions, refer to the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR).

Additional considerations

Form 1099-DIV should break down the distribution into the various categories. If it doesn't, contact the payer.

You must give your correct social security number to the payer of your dividend income. If you don't, you may be subject to a penalty and/or backup withholding. For more information on backup withholding, refer to Topic no. 307.

Sole proprietorships

A business may be organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by an individual. A sole proprietorship has no legal identity apart from its owner. Business debts are obligations of the owner of the business. A limited liability company (LLC) owned by one individual is treated as a sole proprietorship for federal income tax purposes, unless the owner elects to treat the LLC as a corporation. A sole proprietor files Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship) to report the income and expenses of the business and reports the net business earnings on Form 1040 series. A sole proprietor who has net earnings from Schedule C of $400 or more must file Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax. A taxpayer uses Schedule SE to figure self-employment tax, which is the sum of the social security and Medicare taxes on self-employment income. A taxpayer also uses Schedule SE to deduct one-half of the self-employment tax. For more information on sole proprietorships, refer to Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business.

Partnerships

A partnership is an unincorporated business organization where two or more persons join to carry on a trade or business, a financial operation or venture. Each person contributes money, property or services in return for a right to share in the profits and losses of the partnership. An LLC with more than one owner is generally treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes, (spouses in a community property state who are the only owners of an LLC and share in the profits of such, can file as a single member), unless the LLC elects to be treated as a corporation. A partnership reports its income and expenses on Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income. The partnership itself doesn't pay income tax. Each partner receives a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)PDF and/or Schedule K-3 (Form 1065)PDF that indicates the partner's distributive share of partnership income, expenses and other items, determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Partners report on their income tax returns the amounts reported on the Schedule K-1 and/or Schedule K-3. For more information, refer to the Instructions for Form 1065PDF. For more information on partnerships, in general, refer to Publication 541, Partnerships.

Corporations

The term corporation, for federal income tax purposes, generally includes a legal entity treated as separate from the persons who formed it under federal or state law or the shareholders who own it. It also includes certain businesses that elect to be taxed as a corporation by filing Form 8832, Entity Classification Election. Corporations report their income and expenses, and calculate their tax on Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. For more information on corporations, refer to Publication 542, Corporations. Corporations that meet certain requirements may elect to be taxed under subchapter S of the tax code by filing Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation. S corporations file Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation and are generally not subject to regular income tax. Most income and expenses of an S corporation are passed through to the shareholders on Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)PDF and/or Schedule K-3 (Form 1120-S)PDF. The shareholders report on their income tax returns the amounts indicated on the Schedule K-1 and/or Schedule K-3.

Examples of capital assets include a home, personal-use items like household furnishings, and stocks or bonds held as investments. When you sell a capital asset, the difference between the adjusted basis in the asset and the amount you realized from the sale is a capital gain or a capital loss. Generally, an asset's basis is its cost to the owner, but if you received the asset as a gift or inheritance, refer to Publication 551, Basis of Assets for information about your basis. You have a capital gain if you sell the asset for more than your adjusted basis. You have a capital loss if you sell the asset for less than your adjusted basis. Losses from the sale of personal-use property, such as your home or car, aren't tax deductible.

Losses from the sale of personal-use property, such as your home or car, aren't tax deductible.

Short-term or long-term

To correctly arrive at your net capital gain or loss, capital gains and losses are classified as long-term or short-term. Generally, if you hold the asset for more than one year before you dispose of it, your capital gain or loss is long-term. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is short-term. For exceptions to this rule, such as property acquired by gift, property acquired from a decedent, or patent property, refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets; for commodity futures, see Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses; or for applicable partnership interests, see Publication 541, Partnerships. To determine how long you held the asset, you generally count from the day after the day you acquired the asset up to and including the day you disposed of the asset.

If you have a net capital gain, a lower tax rate may apply to the gain than the tax rate that applies to your ordinary income. The term ""net capital gain"" means the amount by which your net long-term capital gain for the year is more than your net short-term capital loss for the year. The term ""net long-term capital gain"" means long-term capital gains reduced by long-term capital losses including any unused long-term capital loss carried over from previous years. The term “net short-term capital loss” means the excess of short-term capital losses (including any unused short-term capital losses carried over from previous years) over short-term capital gains for the year.

Capital gains tax rates

Net capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on overall taxable income, although some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0%. For taxable years beginning in 2023, the tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than 15% for most individuals.

A capital gains rate of 0% applies if your taxable income is less than or equal to:

$44,625 for single and married filing separately;

$89,250 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and

$59,750 for head of household.

A capital gains rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is:

more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $492,300 for single;

more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $276,900 for married filing separately;

more than $89,250 but less than or equal to $553,850 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and

more than $59,750 but less than or equal to $523,050 for head of household.

However, a capital gains rate of 20% applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the 15% capital gain rate.

There are a few other exceptions where capital gains may be taxed at rates greater than 20%:

The taxable part of a gain from selling section 1202 qualified small business stock is taxed at a maximum 28% rate. Net capital gains from selling collectibles (such as coins or art) are taxed at a maximum 28% rate. The portion of any unrecaptured section 1250 gain from selling section 1250 real property is taxed at a maximum 25% rate.

Note: Net short-term capital gains are subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated tax rates.

Limit on the deduction and carryover of losses

If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 16 of Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. Claim the loss on line 7 of your Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. If your net capital loss is more than this limit, you can carry the loss forward to later years. You may use the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet found in Publication 550 or in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040)PDF to figure the amount you can carry forward.

Where to report

Report most sales and other capital transactions and calculate capital gain or loss on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, then summarize capital gains and deductible capital losses on Schedule D (Form 1040).

To correctly arrive at your net capital gain or loss, capital gains and losses are classified as long-term or short-term. Generally, if you hold the asset for more than one year before you dispose of it, your capital gain or loss is long-term. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is short-term. For exceptions to this rule, such as property acquired by gift, property acquired from a decedent, or patent property, refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets; for commodity futures, see Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses; or for applicable partnership interests, see Publication 541, Partnerships. To determine how long you held the asset, you generally count from the day after the day you acquired the asset up to and including the day you disposed of the asset.

If you have a net capital gain, a lower tax rate may apply to the gain than the tax rate that applies to your ordinary income. The term ""net capital gain"" means the amount by which your net long-term capital gain for the year is more than your net short-term capital loss for the year. The term ""net long-term capital gain"" means long-term capital gains reduced by long-term capital losses including any unused long-term capital loss carried over from previous years. The term “net short-term capital loss” means the excess of short-term capital losses (including any unused short-term capital losses carried over from previous years) over short-term capital gains for the year.

Capital gains tax rates

Net capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on overall taxable income, although some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0%. For taxable years beginning in 2023, the tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than 15% for most individuals.

A capital gains rate of 0% applies if your taxable income is less than or equal to:

$44,625 for single and married filing separately;

$89,250 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and

$59,750 for head of household.

A capital gains rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is:

more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $492,300 for single;

more than $44,625 but less than or equal to $276,900 for married filing separately;

more than $89,250 but less than or equal to $553,850 for married filing jointly and qualifying surviving spouse; and

more than $59,750 but less than or equal to $523,050 for head of household.

However, a capital gains rate of 20% applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the 15% capital gain rate.

There are a few other exceptions where capital gains may be taxed at rates greater than 20%:

The taxable part of a gain from selling section 1202 qualified small business stock is taxed at a maximum 28% rate. Net capital gains from selling collectibles (such as coins or art) are taxed at a maximum 28% rate. The portion of any unrecaptured section 1250 gain from selling section 1250 real property is taxed at a maximum 25% rate.

Note: Net short-term capital gains are subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated tax rates.

Limit on the deduction and carryover of losses

If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 16 of Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. Claim the loss on line 7 of your Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. If your net capital loss is more than this limit, you can carry the loss forward to later years. You may use the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet found in Publication 550 or in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040)PDF to figure the amount you can carry forward.

Where to report

Report most sales and other capital transactions and calculate capital gain or loss on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, then summarize capital gains and deductible capital losses on Schedule D (Form 1040).

Estimated tax payments

If you have a taxable capital gain, you may be required to make estimated tax payments. For additional information, refer to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, Estimated Taxes and Am I required to make estimated tax payments?

Net investment income tax

Individuals with significant investment income may be subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). For additional information on the NIIT, see Topic no. 559.

If you contributed after-tax dollars to your pension or annuity, your pension payments are partially taxable. You won't pay tax on the part of the payment that represents a return of the after-tax amount you paid. This amount is your investment in the contract and includes the amounts your employer contributed that were taxable to you when contributed. Taxpayers figure the tax on partly taxable pensions by using either the general rule or the simplified method. For more information on the general rule and simplified method, refer to Topic no. 411. If the starting date of your pension or annuity payments is after November 18, 1996, you generally must use the simplified method to determine how much of your annuity payment is taxable and how much is tax-free.

Additional 10% tax on early distributions

If you receive pension or annuity payments before age 59½, you may be subject to an additional 10% tax on early distributions, unless the distribution qualifies for an exception. The additional tax generally doesn't apply to any part of a distribution that's tax-free or to any of the following types of distributions:

Distributions made as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments that begins after your separation from service.

Distributions made because you're totally and permanently disabled.

Made to you because you're terminally ill.

Distributions made on or after the death of the plan participant or contract holder.

For other exceptions to the additional 10% tax, refer to Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income and Instructions for Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (Including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts.

If you're a survivor or beneficiary of a pension plan participant or annuitant, refer to Publication 575 for rules relating to income inclusion.

Tax withholding

The taxable part of your pension or annuity payments is generally subject to federal income tax withholding.

You may be able to choose not to have income tax withheld from your pension or annuity payments or may want to specify how much tax is withheld. If so, provide the payer Form W-4P, Withholding Certificate for Periodic Pension or Annuity Payments or a similar form provided by the payer along with your social security number (SSN). If you're a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you must provide the payer with a home address in the United States (or its territories) to be able to choose to have no tax withheld. Payers generally figure the withholding from periodic payments of a pension or annuity the same way as for wages. If you don't submit the Form W-4P withholding certificate, you don’t provide your SSN, or the IRS notifies the payer that you gave an incorrect SSN, then the payer must withhold tax as if your filing status is single with no adjustments in Steps 2 through 4.

Special rules apply to certain nonperiodic payments from qualified retirement plans. For information on the special tax treatment of lump-sum distributions, refer to Topic no. 412. If you receive an eligible rollover distribution, the payer must withhold 20% of the taxable amount of it, even if you intend to roll it over later. You can avoid this withholding by choosing the direct rollover option. A distribution sent to you in the form of a check payable to the receiving plan or IRA isn't subject to withholding. For more information on rollovers, refer to Topic no. 413 and visit Do I need to report the transfer or rollover of an IRA or retirement plan on my tax return?

Estimated tax payments

If you pay your taxes through withholding and the withheld tax isn't enough, you may also need to make estimated tax payments to ensure you don't underpay taxes during the tax year.

For more information on increasing withholding tax, making estimated tax payments, and the consequences of not withholding the proper amount of tax, refer to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.

"content: If you were born before January 2, 1936, and you receive a lump-sum distribution from a qualified retirement plan or a qualified retirement annuity, you may be able to elect optional methods of figuring the tax on the distribution. These optional methods can be elected only once after 1986 for any eligible plan participant.

What's a lump-sum distribution?

A lump-sum distribution is the distribution or payment within a single tax year of a plan participant's entire balance from all of the employer's qualified plans of one kind (for example, pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plans). Additionally, a lump-sum distribution is a distribution that's paid:

Because of the plan participant's death,

After the participant reaches age 59½,

Because the participant, if an employee, separates from service, or

After the participant, if a self-employed individual, becomes totally and permanently disabled.

Lump-sum treatment options

You can elect to treat the portion of a lump-sum distribution that's attributable to your active participation in the plan using one of five options:"|"If you were born before January 2, 1936, and you receive a lump-sum distribution from a qualified retirement plan or a qualified retirement annuity, you may be able to elect optional methods of figuring the tax on the distribution.

Lump-sum treatment options

You can elect to treat the portion of a lump-sum distribution that's attributable to your active participation in the plan using one of five options:

Report the taxable part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you qualify) and the taxable part of the distribution from participation after 1973 as ordinary income. Report the taxable part of the distribution from participation before 1974 as a capital gain (if you qualify) and use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the part from participation after 1973 (if you qualify). Use the 10-year tax option to figure the tax on the total taxable amount (if you qualify). Roll over all or part of the distribution. No tax is currently due on the part rolled over. Report any part not rolled over as ordinary income. Report the entire taxable part as ordinary income.

Net unrealized appreciation

If the lump-sum distribution includes employer securities and the payer reported an amount in box 6 of your Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc. for net unrealized appreciation (NUA) in employer securities, the NUA is generally not subject to tax until you sell the securities. However, you may elect to include the NUA in your income in the year the securities are distributed to you.

Capital gain treatment

You should receive a Form 1099-RPDF from the payer of the lump-sum distribution showing your taxable distribution and the amount eligible for capital gain treatment. If your Form 1099-R isn't made available to you by January 31 of the year following the year of the distribution, you should contact the payer of your lump-sum distribution. Or, if by the end of February you haven't received your Form 1099-R, you may call us at 800-829-1040 for assistance; refer to Topic no. 154 for more information.

Transfer or rollover options

You may be able to defer tax on all or part of a lump-sum distribution by requesting the payer to directly roll over the taxable portion into an individual retirement arrangement (IRA) or to an eligible retirement plan. You may also be able to defer tax on a distribution paid to you by rolling over the taxable amount to an IRA within 60 days after receipt of the distribution. If you do a rollover, the regular IRA distribution rules will apply to any later distributions, and you can't use the special tax treatment rules for lump-sums (described earlier). For more information on rollovers, refer to Topic no. 413 and Do I need to report the transfer or rollover of an IRA or retirement plan on my tax return?

Mandatory withholding

Mandatory income tax withholding of 20% applies to most taxable distributions paid directly to you in a lump sum from employer retirement plans even if you plan to roll over the taxable amount within 60 days. Note that the default rate of withholding may be too low for your tax situation. You may choose to provide the payer Form W-4R, Withholding Certificate for Nonperiodic Payments and Eligible Rollover Distributions to elect to have more than 20% withheld.

You must include the taxable amount of a distribution that you don't roll over in income in the year of the distribution.

Ineligible distributions

Certain distributions from an eligible retirement plan can't be rolled over, including:

A distribution that's one of a series of payments made for your life (or life expectancy), or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of you and your beneficiary, or made for a specified period of 10 years or more; A required minimum distribution; A hardship distribution from an employer retirement plan; Corrective distributions of excess contributions or excess deferrals, and any income allocable to these distributions, or of excess annual additions and any allocable gains; A loan treated as a distribution because it doesn't satisfy certain requirements either when made or later (such as upon default), unless the participant's accrued benefits are reduced (offset) to repay the loan; Dividends paid on employer securities; or The cost of life insurance coverage.

Rollover of nontaxable amounts

You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such as your after-tax contributions) made to another qualified retirement plan that is a qualified employee plan or a 403(b) plan, or to a traditional or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct rollover to a qualified plan or 403(b) plan that separately accounts for the taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover or through a rollover to a traditional or Roth IRA.

Timeframe to complete a rollover

If a plan pays you an eligible rollover distribution, you have 60 days from the date you receive it to roll it over to another eligible retirement plan. Or, if you have a qualified plan loan offset amount, you have until the due date (including extensions) for the tax year in which the offset occurs to complete an eligible rollover. Refer to Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income for more information.

If you've missed the 60-day deadline, you may still be able to complete a rollover by self-certifying that you qualify for a waiver of the 60-day requirement. For details, see Revenue Procedures 2016-47PDF and 2020-46PDF.

The 60-day period may be postponed if you were affected by a federally declared disaster, or by a significant fire for which assistance is provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Also, if you took a qualified disaster distribution from a retirement plan and want to repay it, generally, you have 3 years to do so.

Withholding

Any taxable eligible rollover distribution paid to you from an employer-sponsored retirement plan is subject to a mandatory income tax withholding of 20%, even if you intend to roll it over later. If you do roll it over and want to defer tax on the entire taxable portion, you'll have to add funds from other sources equal to the amount withheld. Note that the default rate of withholding may be too low for your tax situation. You may choose to provide the payer Form W-4R, Withholding Certificate for Nonperiodic Payments and Eligible Rollover Distributions, to elect to have more than 20% withheld.

You can choose instead a direct rollover, in which you have the payer transfer a distribution directly to another eligible retirement plan (including an IRA). The 20% mandatory withholding doesn't apply in a direct rollover.

Additional taxes

"Rollover of nontaxable amounts

You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such as your after-tax contributions) made to another qualified retirement plan that is a qualified employee plan or a 403(b) plan, or to a traditional or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct rollover to a qualified plan or 403(b) plan that separately accounts for the taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover or through a rollover to a traditional or Roth IRA.

Timeframe to complete a rollover

If a plan pays you an eligible rollover distribution, you have 60 days from the date you receive it to roll it over to another eligible retirement plan. Or, if you have a qualified plan loan offset amount, you have until the due date (including extensions) for the tax year in which the offset occurs to complete an eligible rollover. Refer to Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income for more information.

If you've missed the 60-day deadline, you may still be able to complete a rollover by self-certifying that you qualify for a waiver of the 60-day requirement. For details, see Revenue Procedures 2016-47PDF and 2020-46PDF."|"A rollover occurs when you withdraw cash or other assets from one eligible retirement plan and contribute all or part of it, within 60 days, to another eligible retirement plan. This rollover transaction isn't taxable, unless the rollover is to a Roth IRA or a designated Roth account from another type of plan or account, but it is reportable on your federal tax return. You must include the taxable amount of a distribution that you don't roll over in income in the year of the distribution.

Ineligible distributions

Certain distributions from an eligible retirement plan can't be rolled over, including:

A distribution that's one of a series of payments made for your life (or life expectancy), or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of you and your beneficiary, or made for a specified period of 10 years or more; A required minimum distribution; A hardship distribution from an employer retirement plan; Corrective distributions of excess contributions or excess deferrals, and any income allocable to these distributions, or of excess annual additions and any allocable gains; A loan treated as a distribution because it doesn't satisfy certain requirements either when made or later (such as upon default), unless the participant's accrued benefits are reduced (offset) to repay the loan; Dividends paid on employer securities; or The cost of life insurance coverage.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Also, if you took a qualified disaster distribution from a retirement plan and want to repay it, generally, you have 3 years to do so.

Withholding

Any taxable eligible rollover distribution paid to you from an employer-sponsored retirement plan is subject to a mandatory income tax withholding of 20%, even if you intend to roll it over later. If you do roll it over and want to defer tax on the entire taxable portion, you'll have to add funds from other sources equal to the amount withheld. Note that the default rate of withholding may be too low for your tax situation. You may choose to provide the payer Form W-4R, Withholding Certificate for Nonperiodic Payments and Eligible Rollover Distributions, to elect to have more than 20% withheld.

You can choose instead a direct rollover, in which you have the payer transfer a distribution directly to another eligible retirement plan (including an IRA). The 20% mandatory withholding doesn't apply in a direct rollover.

If you keep part or all of the security deposit because the tenant damaged the property and you must make repairs, include the amount you keep in that year if your practice is to deduct the cost of repairs as expenses. To the extent the security deposit reimburses those expenses, don't include the amount in income if your practice isn't to deduct the cost of repairs as expenses. If a security deposit amount is to be used as the tenant's final month's rent, it is advance rent that you include as income when you receive it, rather than when you apply it to the last month's rent.

Rental expenses

Examples of expenses that you may deduct from your total rental income include:

Depreciation – Allowances for exhaustion, wear and tear (including obsolescence) of property. You begin to depreciate your rental property when you place it in service. You can recover some or all of your original acquisition cost and the cost of improvements by using Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization (to report depreciation) beginning in the year your rental property is first placed in service, and beginning in any year you make improvements or add furnishings.

These expenses, which may include mortgage interest, real estate taxes, casualty losses, maintenance, utilities, insurance, and depreciation, will reduce the amount of rental income that's subject to tax. You'll generally report such income and expenses on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors and on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss.

14 days, or 10% of the total days you rent it to others at a fair rental price.

It's possible that you'll use more than one dwelling unit as a residence during the year. For example, if you live in your main home for 11 months, your home is a dwelling unit used as a residence. If you live in your vacation home for the other 30 days of the year, your vacation home is also a dwelling unit used as a residence unless you rent your vacation home to others at a fair rental value for 300 or more days during the year in this example.

A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that the unit is used by:

You or any other person who has an interest in it, unless you rent your interest to another owner as their main home and the other owner pays a fair rental price under a shared equity financing agreement

A member of your family or of a family of any other person who has an interest in it, unless the family member uses it as their main home and pays a fair rental price

Anyone under an agreement that lets you use some other dwelling unit

Anyone at less than fair rental price

Minimal rental use

There's a special rule if you use a dwelling unit as a residence and rent it for fewer than 15 days. In this case, don't report any of the rental income and don't deduct any expenses as rental expenses.

Dividing expenses between rental and personal use

If you use the dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes, you generally must divide your total expenses between the rental use and the personal use based on the number of days used for each purpose. You won't be able to deduct your rental expense in excess of the gross rental income limitation (your gross rental income less the rental portion of mortgage interest, real estate taxes, casualty losses, and rental expenses like realtors' fees and advertising costs). However, you may be able to carry forward some of these rental expenses to the next year, subject to the gross rental income limitation for that year. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions, you may still be able to deduct your personal portion of mortgage interest, property taxes, and casualty losses from federally declared disasters on that schedule.

If you use the dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes, you generally must divide your total expenses between the rental use and the personal use based on the number of days used for each purpose. You won't be able to deduct your rental expense in excess of the gross rental income limitation (your gross rental income less the rental portion of mortgage interest, real estate taxes, casualty losses, and rental expenses like realtors' fees and advertising costs). However, you may be able to carry forward some of these rental expenses to the next year, subject to the gross rental income limitation for that year. If you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions, you may still be able to deduct your personal portion of mortgage interest, property taxes, and casualty losses from federally declared disasters on that schedule.

Net investment income tax

If you have a rental income, you may be subject to the net investment income tax (NIIT). For more information, refer to Topic no. 559.

For more information on residential rental property income and expenses, refer to Topic no. 414 and Is my residential rental income taxable and/or are my expenses deductible?"|"If you receive rental income for the use of a dwelling unit, such as a house or an apartment, you may deduct certain expenses. These expenses, which may include mortgage interest, real estate taxes, casualty losses, maintenance, utilities, insurance, and depreciation, will reduce the amount of rental income that's subject to tax. You'll generally report such income and expenses on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors and on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss. If you're renting to make a profit and don't use the dwelling unit as a residence, then your deductible rental expenses may be more than your gross rental income. Your rental losses, however, generally will be limited by the ""at-risk"" rules and/or the passive activity loss rules. For information on these limits, refer to Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.

Rental property / Personal use

If you rent a dwelling unit to others that you also use as a residence, limitations may apply to the rental expenses you can deduct. You're considered to use a dwelling unit as a residence if you use it for personal purposes during the tax year for a number of days that’s more than the greater of:

14 days, or 10% of the total days you rent it to others at a fair rental price.

It's possible that you'll use more than one dwelling unit as a residence during the year. For example, if you live in your main home for 11 months, your home is a dwelling unit used as a residence. If you live in your vacation home for the other 30 days of the year, your vacation home is also a dwelling unit used as a residence unless you rent your vacation home to others at a fair rental value for 300 or more days during the year in this example.

A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that the unit is used by:

You or any other person who has an interest in it, unless you rent your interest to another owner as their main home and the other owner pays a fair rental price under a shared equity financing agreement

A member of your family or of a family of any other person who has an interest in it, unless the family member uses it as their main home and pays a fair rental price

Anyone under an agreement that lets you use some other dwelling unit

Anyone at less than fair rental price

Minimal rental use

There's a special rule if you use a dwelling unit as a residence and rent it for fewer than 15 days. In this case, don't report any of the rental income and don't deduct any expenses as rental expenses.

However, the way you treat expenses related to those earnings generally differs if you earn the income as an employee or as a self-employed person.

Employee or self-employed

For income tax purposes, facts and circumstances determine whether you're considered an employee or a self-employed person under common-law rules. Generally, you're an employee if the church or organization you perform services for has the legal right to control both what you do and how you do it, even if you have considerable discretion and freedom of action. For more information about the common-law rules, see Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide. If a congregation employs you for a salary, you're generally a common-law employee of the congregation and your salary is considered wages for income tax withholding purposes. However, amounts you receive directly from members of the congregation, such as fees for performing marriages, baptisms, or other personal services, are generally earnings from self-employment for income tax purposes even if you’re an employee otherwise. Both the salary you receive from the congregation and fees you receive from members of the congregation may be included for social security coverage purposes and subject to self-employment tax (see below).

If you're an independent contractor, the offerings or fees you receive for performing marriages, baptisms, funerals, etc. are self-employment income. Use Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) to report these earnings and related expenses.

Housing allowance

A licensed, commissioned, or ordained minister who performs ministerial services as an employee may be able to exclude from gross income the fair rental value of a home provided as part of compensation (a parsonage) or a housing allowance provided as compensation if it is used to rent or otherwise provide a home. A minister who is furnished a parsonage may exclude from gross income the fair rental value of the parsonage, including utilities. However, the amount excluded can't be more than reasonable compensation for the minister's services.

A minister who receives a housing allowance may exclude the allowance from gross income to the extent it's used to pay expenses in providing a home. Generally, those expenses include rent, mortgage interest, utilities, and other expenses directly relating to providing a home. The amount excluded can't be more than reasonable compensation for the minister's services.

If you own your home, you may still claim deductions for mortgage interest and real property taxes. If your housing allowance exceeds the lesser of your reasonable compensation, the fair rental value of the home, or your actual expenses directly relating to providing the home, you must include the amount of the excess in income.

In order to be able to exclude the housing allowance from income, the minister's employing organization must officially designate the housing allowance as such before paying it to the minister.

The fair rental value of a parsonage or the housing allowance is excludable only for income tax purposes. The minister must include the amount of the fair rental value of a parsonage or the housing allowance for social security coverage purposes.

Social Security coverage

The services you perform in the exercise of your ministry are generally covered by Social Security and Medicare under the self-employment tax system, regardless of your status under the common law. This means that your salary on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, the net profit on Schedule C, and your housing allowance less pertinent deductible expenses are subject to self-employment tax on Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax.

See Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers for limited exceptions from self-employment tax.

Exemption from self-employment tax

You can request an exemption from self-employment tax for your ministerial earnings, if you're opposed to certain public insurance for religious or conscientious reasons. You can't request exemption for economic reasons. To request the exemption, file Form 4361, Application for Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners with the IRS. You must file it by the due date of your income tax return (including extensions) for the second tax year in which you have net earnings from self-employment of at least $400. This rule applies if any part of your net earnings from each of the two years came from the performance of ministerial services. The two years don't have to be consecutive. The exemption is granted if IRS approves your application. Once granted, the exemption is irrevocable.

The amount excluded can't be more than reasonable compensation for the minister's services.

If you own your home, you may still claim deductions for mortgage interest and real property taxes. If your housing allowance exceeds the lesser of your reasonable compensation, the fair rental value of the home, or your actual expenses directly relating to providing the home, you must include the amount of the excess in income.

In order to be able to exclude the housing allowance from income, the minister's employing organization must officially designate the housing allowance as such before paying it to the minister.

The fair rental value of a parsonage or the housing allowance is excludable only for income tax purposes. The minister must include the amount of the fair rental value of a parsonage or the housing allowance for social security coverage purposes.

Social Security coverage

The services you perform in the exercise of your ministry are generally covered by Social Security and Medicare under the self-employment tax system, regardless of your status under the common law. This means that your salary on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, the net profit on Schedule C, and your housing allowance less pertinent deductible expenses are subject to self-employment tax on Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax.

See Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers for limited exceptions from self-employment tax.

Exemption from self-employment tax

You can request an exemption from self-employment tax for your ministerial earnings, if you're opposed to certain public insurance for religious or conscientious reasons. You can't request exemption for economic reasons. To request the exemption, file Form 4361, Application for Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners with the IRS. You must file it by the due date of your income tax return (including extensions) for the second tax year in which you have net earnings from self-employment of at least $400. This rule applies if any part of your net earnings from each of the two years came from the performance of ministerial services. The two years don't have to be consecutive. The exemption is granted if IRS approves your application. Once granted, the exemption is irrevocable.

Additional information

For more information, refer to Do I have income subject to self-employment tax?"|"A licensed, commissioned, or ordained minister is generally the common law employee of the church, denomination, sect, or organization that employs him or her to provide ministerial services. However, there are some exceptions, such as traveling evangelists who are independent contractors (self-employed) under the common law. Regardless of whether you're a minister performing ministerial services as an employee or a self-employed person, all of your earnings, including wages, offerings, and fees you receive for performing marriages, baptisms, funerals, etc., are subject to income tax. However, the way you treat expenses related to those earnings generally differs if you earn the income as an employee or as a self-employed person.

Employee or self-employed

For income tax purposes, facts and circumstances determine whether you're considered an employee or a self-employed person under common-law rules. Generally, you're an employee if the church or organization you perform services for has the legal right to control both what you do and how you do it, even if you have considerable discretion and freedom of action. For more information about the common-law rules, see Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide. If a congregation employs you for a salary, you're generally a common-law employee of the congregation and your salary is considered wages for income tax withholding purposes. However, amounts you receive directly from members of the congregation, such as fees for performing marriages, baptisms, or other personal services, are generally earnings from self-employment for income tax purposes even if you’re an employee otherwise. Both the salary you receive from the congregation and fees you receive from members of the congregation may be included for social security coverage purposes and subject to self-employment tax (see below).

If you're an independent contractor, the offerings or fees you receive for performing marriages, baptisms, funerals, etc. are self-employment income. Use Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) to report these earnings and related expenses.

Housing allowance

A licensed, commissioned, or ordained minister who performs ministerial services as an employee may be able to exclude from gross income the fair rental value of a home provided as part of compensation (a parsonage) or a housing allowance provided as compensation if it is used to rent or otherwise provide a home. A minister who is furnished a parsonage may exclude from gross income the fair rental value of the parsonage, including utilities. However, the amount excluded can't be more than reasonable compensation for the minister's services.

For more information, refer to Topic no. 558, Additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs or Do I meet an exception to the additional tax on early distributions from IRAs or retirement plans? Qualification for a hardship distribution isn't an exception to the additional 10% tax. For more information about the treatment of retirement plan distributions, refer to Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income."|"A 401(k) plan is a qualified deferred compensation plan. If you're eligible under the plan, you generally can elect to have your employer contribute a portion of your compensation to the plan on a pretax basis. Generally, your deferred compensation (commonly referred to as elective contributions) isn't subject to income tax withholding at the time of deferral, and you don't report it as wages on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, because it isn't included in box 1 wages on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. However, it's included as wages subject to withholding for social security and Medicare taxes. In addition, your employer must report the elective contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes. Some plans also allow you to elect to make your elective contributions on an after-tax basis as designated Roth contributions.

Contributions

The Internal Revenue Code limits the amount that an employee may elect to defer in a 401(k) plan. Your elective contributions may also be limited based on the terms of your 401(k) plan and are reported as an information item in box 12 of your Form W-2. Refer to Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income for more information about elective contributions. Employers should refer to Publication 560, Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans) for information about setting up and maintaining retirement plans for employees, including 401(k) plans.

Distributions

The plan will specify the form of distribution. Some distributions from a 401(k) plan may qualify for lump-sum distribution treatment or rollover treatment as long as they meet the respective requirements. For more information, refer to Topic no. 412, Lump-sum distributions, Do I need to report the transfer or rollover of an IRA or retirement plan on my tax return? and Topic no. 413, Rollovers from retirement plans. To determine if your distribution is taxable, refer to Is my pension or annuity payment taxable?

Hardship withdrawals - Many 401(k) plans allow employees to make a hardship withdrawal because of immediate and heavy financial needs. Historically, hardship distributions from a 401(k) plan were generally limited to the amount of the employees' elective contributions only, and didn't include any income earned on the deferred amounts. However, since 2019, the plan may expand the funds available for hardship distributions. Hardship distributions aren't treated as eligible rollover distributions.

Additional 10% tax - Distributions received before age 59½ are subject to an additional 10% tax unless an exception applies. For more information, refer to Topic no. 558, Additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs or Do I meet an exception to the additional tax on early distributions from IRAs or retirement plans?

This topic also discusses the mark-to-market election under Internal Revenue Code section 475(f) for a trader in securities. In general, under section 475(c)(2), the term security includes a share of stock, beneficial ownership interests in certain partnerships and trusts, evidence of indebtedness, and certain notional principal contracts, as well as evidence of an interest in, or a derivative financial instrument in, any of these items and certain identified hedges of these items. To better understand the special rules that apply to traders in securities, it's helpful to review the meaning of the terms investor, dealer, and trader, and the different manner in which they report the income and expenses relating to their activities.

Investors

Investors typically buy and sell securities and expect income from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation. They buy and sell these securities and hold them for personal investment; they're not conducting a trade or business. Most investors are individuals and hold these securities for a substantial period of time. Sales of these securities result in capital gains and losses that must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses and on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets as appropriate. Investors are subject to the capital loss limitations described in section 1211(b), in addition to the section 1091 wash sales rules. Commissions and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities aren't deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss upon disposition of the securities. Review Topic no. 703, Basis of assets for additional information. Investment income isn't subject to self-employment tax. For more information on investors, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.

Dealers

Dealers in securities may be individuals or business entities. Dealers regularly purchase or sell securities to their customers in the ordinary course of their trade or business. Dealers also can hold themselves out as willing to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in securities with customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business. Sometimes they maintain an inventory. Dealers are distinguished from investors and traders because they have customers and derive their income from marketing securities for sale to customers or from being compensated for services provided as an intermediary or market-maker. Section 475 requires dealers to keep and maintain records that clearly identify securities held for personal gain versus those held for use in their business activity. Dealers must report gains and losses associated with securities by using the mark-to-market rules discussed below.

Traders

Special rules apply if you're a trader in securities, in the business of buying and selling securities for your own account. The law considers this to be a business, even though a trader doesn't maintain an inventory and doesn't have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in securities, you must meet all of the following conditions:

You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;

Your activity must be substantial; and

You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.

The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business:

Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold;

The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year;

The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood; and

The amount of time you devote to the activity.

If the nature of your trading activities doesn't qualify as a business, you're considered an investor and not a trader. It doesn't matter whether you call yourself a trader or a day trader, you're an investor. A taxpayer may be a trader in some securities and may hold other securities for investment. The special rules for traders don't apply to those securities held for investment. A trader must keep detailed records to distinguish the securities held for investment from the securities in the trading business. The securities held for investment must be identified as such in the trader's records on the day the trader acquires them (for example, by holding them in a separate brokerage account).

Traders report their business expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship). Commissions and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities aren't deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss upon disposition of the securities. See Topic no. 703, Basis of assets. Gains and losses from selling securities from being a trader aren't subject to self-employment tax.

The mark-to-market election

Traders can choose to use the mark-to-market rules, investors can't. If you as a trader don't make a valid mark-to-market election under section 475(f), then you must treat the gains and losses from sales of securities as capital gains and losses and report the sales on Schedule D (Form 1040) and on Form 8949 as appropriate. When reporting on Schedule D, both the limitations on capital losses and the wash sales rules continue to apply. However, if you make a timely mark-to-market election, then the gains and losses from sales of securities are generally treated as ordinary gains and losses (except for securities held for investment - see above) that must be reported on Part II of Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. Neither the limitations on capital losses nor the wash sale rules apply to traders using the mark-to-market method of accounting.

As a trader, you must make the mark-to-market election by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You can make the election by attaching a statement either to your income tax return if filed without an extension or to a request for an extension of time to file your return. The statement should include the following information:

That you're making an election under section 475(f); The first tax year for which the election is effective (that is, the tax year for which a timely election is being made); and The trade or business for which you're making the election.

If you’re a new taxpayer that wasn’t required to file a tax return for the prior year, you may make the election by placing the above statement in your books and records no later than 2 months and 15 days after the first day of the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You must attach a copy of the statement to your tax return for that year.

Dealers

Dealers in securities may be individuals or business entities. Dealers regularly purchase or sell securities to their customers in the ordinary course of their trade or business. Dealers also can hold themselves out as willing to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in securities with customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business. Sometimes they maintain an inventory. Dealers are distinguished from investors and traders because they have customers and derive their income from marketing securities for sale to customers or from being compensated for services provided as an intermediary or market-maker. Section 475 requires dealers to keep and maintain records that clearly identify securities held for personal gain versus those held for use in their business activity. Dealers must report gains and losses associated with securities by using the mark-to-market rules discussed below.

Traders

Special rules apply if you're a trader in securities, in the business of buying and selling securities for your own account. The law considers this to be a business, even though a trader doesn't maintain an inventory and doesn't have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in securities, you must meet all of the following conditions:

You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;

Your activity must be substantial; and

You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.

The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business:

Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold;

The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year;

The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood; and

The amount of time you devote to the activity.

If the nature of your trading activities doesn't qualify as a business, you're considered an investor and not a trader. It doesn't matter whether you call yourself a trader or a day trader, you're an investor. A taxpayer may be a trader in some securities and may hold other securities for investment. The special rules for traders don't apply to those securities held for investment. A trader must keep detailed records to distinguish the securities held for investment from the securities in the trading business. The securities held for investment must be identified as such in the trader's records on the day the trader acquires them (for example, by holding them in a separate brokerage account).

Traders report their business expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship). Commissions and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities aren't deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss upon disposition of the securities. See Topic no. 703, Basis of assets. Gains and losses from selling securities from being a trader aren't subject to self-employment tax.

The mark-to-market election

Traders can choose to use the mark-to-market rules, investors can't. If you as a trader don't make a valid mark-to-market election under section 475(f), then you must treat the gains and losses from sales of securities as capital gains and losses and report the sales on Schedule D (Form 1040) and on Form 8949 as appropriate. When reporting on Schedule D, both the limitations on capital losses and the wash sales rules continue to apply. However, if you make a timely mark-to-market election, then the gains and losses from sales of securities are generally treated as ordinary gains and losses (except for securities held for investment - see above) that must be reported on Part II of Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. Neither the limitations on capital losses nor the wash sale rules apply to traders using the mark-to-market method of accounting.

As a trader, you must make the mark-to-market election by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You can make the election by attaching a statement either to your income tax return if filed without an extension or to a request for an extension of time to file your return. The statement should include the following information:

That you're making an election under section 475(f); The first tax year for which the election is effective (that is, the tax year for which a timely election is being made); and The trade or business for which you're making the election.

If you’re a new taxpayer that wasn’t required to file a tax return for the prior year, you may make the election by placing the above statement in your books and records no later than 2 months and 15 days after the first day of the year for which you intend the election to become effective.

Sales of these securities result in capital gains and losses that must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses and on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets as appropriate. Investors are subject to the capital loss limitations described in section 1211(b), in addition to the section 1091 wash sales rules. Commissions and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities aren't deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss upon disposition of the securities.

Dealers

Dealers in securities may be individuals or business entities. Dealers regularly purchase or sell securities to their customers in the ordinary course of their trade or business. Dealers also can hold themselves out as willing to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in securities with customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business. Sometimes they maintain an inventory. Dealers are distinguished from investors and traders because they have customers and derive their income from marketing securities for sale to customers or from being compensated for services provided as an intermediary or market-maker. Section 475 requires dealers to keep and maintain records that clearly identify securities held for personal gain versus those held for use in their business activity. Dealers must report gains and losses associated with securities by using the mark-to-market rules discussed below.

Traders

Special rules apply if you're a trader in securities, in the business of buying and selling securities for your own account. The law considers this to be a business, even though a trader doesn't maintain an inventory and doesn't have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in securities, you must meet all of the following conditions:

You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;

Your activity must be substantial; and

You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.

The following facts and circumstances should be considered in determining if your activity is a securities trading business:

Typical holding periods for securities bought and sold;

The frequency and dollar amount of your trades during the year;

The extent to which you pursue the activity to produce income for a livelihood; and

The amount of time you devote to the activity.

If the nature of your trading activities doesn't qualify as a business, you're considered an investor and not a trader. It doesn't matter whether you call yourself a trader or a day trader, you're an investor. A taxpayer may be a trader in some securities and may hold other securities for investment. The special rules for traders don't apply to those securities held for investment. A trader must keep detailed records to distinguish the securities held for investment from the securities in the trading business. The securities held for investment must be identified as such in the trader's records on the day the trader acquires them (for example, by holding them in a separate brokerage account).

Traders report their business expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship). Commissions and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities aren't deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss upon disposition of the securities. See Topic no. 703, Basis of assets. Gains and losses from selling securities from being a trader aren't subject to self-employment tax.

The mark-to-market election

Traders can choose to use the mark-to-market rules, investors can't. If you as a trader don't make a valid mark-to-market election under section 475(f), then you must treat the gains and losses from sales of securities as capital gains and losses and report the sales on Schedule D (Form 1040) and on Form 8949 as appropriate. When reporting on Schedule D, both the limitations on capital losses and the wash sales rules continue to apply. However, if you make a timely mark-to-market election, then the gains and losses from sales of securities are generally treated as ordinary gains and losses (except for securities held for investment - see above) that must be reported on Part II of Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. Neither the limitations on capital losses nor the wash sale rules apply to traders using the mark-to-market method of accounting.

As a trader, you must make the mark-to-market election by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You can make the election by attaching a statement either to your income tax return if filed without an extension or to a request for an extension of time to file your return. The statement should include the following information:

That you're making an election under section 475(f); The first tax year for which the election is effective (that is, the tax year for which a timely election is being made); and The trade or business for which you're making the election.

If you’re a new taxpayer that wasn’t required to file a tax return for the prior year, you may make the election by placing the above statement in your books and records no later than 2 months and 15 days after the first day of the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You must attach a copy of the statement to your tax return for that year.

Refer to the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and LossesPDF and Revenue Procedure 99-17PDF for more information on how to make the mark-to-market election. It's important to note that in general, late section 475(f) elections aren't allowed.

After making the election, the mark-to-market method of accounting is the only permissible method for your securities for the tax year for which the election is effective. If your previous method of accounting for securities was anything other than the mark-to-market method, you must change your method under Revenue Procedure 2023-24PDF, Section 24.01, by filing a Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method.

If you've made a valid election under section 475(f), the only way to stop using mark-to-market accounting for securities is to file both a notification statement that revokes the election under Revenue Procedure 2023-24, Section 24.02, and a Form 3115 to change your method of accounting for securities from the mark-to-market method to a realization method. Under Revenue Procedure 2023-24, Section 24.02, the notification statement must be filed by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which you intend the revocation to become effective. This notification statement must be attached to either that return or, if applicable, to a request for extension of time to file that return. Late revocations are generally not allowed except in unusual and compelling circumstances.

If you revoke a section 475(f) election within five years of making the election, you must file the notification statement as described above, but you must file the Form 3115 under the non-automatic change procedures of Revenue Procedure 2015-13PDF (user fee required). Similarly, if you make a section 475(f) election within five years of revoking a section 475 election, you must file the election statement as described above, but you must file the Form 3115 under the non-automatic change procedures of Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (user fee required)."|58| types of income|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429|468da4fbe95f4c9f8a36d670d721531d

If you’re a new taxpayer that wasn’t required to file a tax return for the prior year, you may make the election by placing the above statement in your books and records no later than 2 months and 15 days after the first day of the year for which you intend the election to become effective. You must attach a copy of the statement to your tax return for that year.

Refer to the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and LossesPDF and Revenue Procedure 99-17PDF for more information on how to make the mark-to-market election. It's important to note that in general, late section 475(f) elections aren't allowed.

After making the election, the mark-to-market method of accounting is the only permissible method for your securities for the tax year for which the election is effective. If your previous method of accounting for securities was anything other than the mark-to-market method, you must change your method under Revenue Procedure 2023-24PDF, Section 24.01, by filing a Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method.

If you've made a valid election under section 475(f), the only way to stop using mark-to-market accounting for securities is to file both a notification statement that revokes the election under Revenue Procedure 2023-24, Section 24.02, and a Form 3115 to change your method of accounting for securities from the mark-to-market method to a realization method. Under Revenue Procedure 2023-24, Section 24.02, the notification statement must be filed by the original due date (not including extensions) of the tax return for the year prior to the year for which you intend the revocation to become effective. This notification statement must be attached to either that return or, if applicable, to a request for extension of time to file that return. Late revocations are generally not allowed except in unusual and compelling circumstances.

If you revoke a section 475(f) election within five years of making the election, you must file the notification statement as described above, but you must file the Form 3115 under the non-automatic change procedures of Revenue Procedure 2015-13PDF (user fee required). Similarly, if you make a section 475(f) election within five years of revoking a section 475 election, you must file the election statement as described above, but you must file the Form 3115 under the non-automatic change procedures of Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (user fee required)."|58| types of income|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429|734ba59de83940a28b67e7b3174b7491
"content: A mutual insurance company is owned by its policyholders whose ownership interests don't exist in the form of stock. The insurance policy sets the terms of the policyholder's ownership. When a mutual insurance company demutualizes and becomes a stock company, an eligible policyholder generally elects to receive newly issued stock in the new stock company or cash. At the same time, the insurance policy is modified only by changing the name of the issuing company and eliminating the voting and liquidation rights.

Generally, a demutualization is a tax-free reorganization under Internal Revenue Code section 368. For more information, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses. If the demutualization qualifies as a tax-free reorganization and you elected to receive stock, for tax purposes you'll be treated as having exchanged your voting and liquidation rights for stock of the demutualized company. Your holding period for the new stock includes the period you held the policy in the former mutual company.

"content: If you borrow money and are legally obligated to repay a fixed or determinable amount at a future date, you have a debt. You may be personally liable for a debt or may own a property that secures a debt for which you may or may not also be personally liable.

If your debt is forgiven or discharged for less than the full amount owed, the debt is considered canceled for the forgiven or discharged amount that you no longer need to pay. Cancellation of a debt may occur if the creditor can't collect, or gives up on collecting, the amount you're obligated to pay. If you own property securing a debt, cancellation of the debt may occur due to foreclosure, repossession, voluntary transfer of the property to the lender, abandonment of the property, or a mortgage modification.

In general, if your debt is canceled, forgiven, or discharged for less than the amount owed, the amount of the canceled debt is taxable. If taxable, you must report the canceled debt on your tax return for the year in which the cancellation occurred.

However, the law provides several exceptions in which the discharged amount is not considered canceled debt. These exceptions will be discussed later.

After a debt is canceled, the creditor may send you a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt showing the amount canceled and date of cancellation. Contact the creditor if you receive a 1099-C reflecting incorrect information. If a creditor continues to attempt to collect the debt after you receive a 1099-C, the debt may not have been canceled and you may not have income from a canceled debt. Verify your specific situation with the creditor. Your responsibility to report the correct taxable amount of canceled debt as income on your tax return for the year in which the cancellation occurred remains, regardless of the accuracy of the Form 1099-C you received.

In general, you must report any taxable amount of a canceled debt as ordinary income on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return (attach Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Additional Income and Adjustments to IncomePDF ) if the debt is a nonbusiness debt, or on an applicable schedule if the debt is a business debt. See Publication 4681.

Caution: If your debt is secured by property, and the creditor takes that property in full or partial satisfaction of your debt, you are treated as having sold that property to the creditor. The tax treatment of the deemed sale depends on whether you were personally liable for the debt (recourse debt) or not personally liable for the debt (nonrecourse debt).

For recourse debt, your amount realized on the sale is the fair market value (FMV) of the property. The difference between FMV and your adjusted basis (usually your cost) will be a gain or loss on the disposition of the property. Your ordinary income from the cancellation of the debt is the amount by which the discharged debt exceeds the FMV of the property. Include this cancellation of debt in gross income unless an exception or exclusion, discussed below, applies.

For nonrecourse debt, your amount realized is the entire amount of the nonrecourse debt, plus the amount of cash and the FMV of any non-cash property you received. You will not have ordinary income resulting from debt cancellation.

The examples below show the difference between how recourse and nonrecourse debt is treated.

You bought a boat for business use for $20,000, paying $2,000 down and signing a recourse note for $18,000. After paying down $4,000 on the note, you are no longer able to make payments. The boat dealer repossesses the boat, which is now worth $11,000, and cancels the remaining balance ($3,000). Your adjusted basis in the boat is now $10,000 due to allowable depreciation deductions of $10,000. You will have ordinary income from cancellation of debt of $3,000 ($14,000 remaining debt owed minus $11,000 FMV of boat). You will have $1,000 of gain on disposition of the boat, the excess of the boat's FMV of $11,000 (the amount you realized on repossession) over your $10,000 adjusted basis in the boat. The facts are the same except that you signed a nonrecourse note when buying the boat. When the dealer repossesses the boat, you will have gain of $4,000, the difference between the $14,000 realized (the face amount of the remaining debt) and your $10,000 adjusted basis in the boat. You have no ordinary income from cancellation of the debt.

See Publication 4681 for detailed information on canceled debt and on reporting a gain or loss from repossession, foreclosure, or abandonment of property. See also Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets and Publication 523, Selling Your Home.

Amounts that meet the requirements for any of the following exceptions aren't cancellation of debt income.

EXCEPTIONS to cancellation of debt income:

Amounts canceled as gifts, bequests, devises, or inheritances Certain qualified student loans containing loan provisions for cancellation based on length of employment in certain professions for a broad class of employers Certain student loan discharges after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2026 Amounts received or forgiven under certain student loan repayment assistance programs Amounts of canceled debt that would be deductible if you, as a cash basis taxpayer, had paid it A qualified purchase price reduction given by the seller of property to the buyer

Amounts that meet the requirements for any of the following exclusions aren't included in income, even though they're cancellation of debt income.

EXCLUSIONS from gross income:

Debt canceled in a Title 11 bankruptcy case Debt canceled to the extent insolvent Cancellation of qualified farm indebtedness Cancellation of qualified real property business indebtedness Cancellation of qualified principal residence indebtedness that is discharged before January 1, 2026, or discharged subject to an arrangement that is entered into and evidenced in writing before January 1, 2026

Generally, if you exclude canceled debt from income under one of the exclusions listed above, you must reduce certain tax attributes (certain credits and carryovers, losses and carryovers, basis of assets, etc.) (but not below zero) by the amount excluded. You must report the amount qualifying for exclusion, and any corresponding reduction of those tax attributes on Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment) and attach to your tax return. For cancellation of qualified principal residence indebtedness that's excluded from income, you must only reduce your basis in your principal residence. For cancellation of qualified real property business indebtedness, you must only reduce your basis in your depreciable real property.

You bought a boat for business use for $20,000, paying $2,000 down and signing a recourse note for $18,000. After paying down $4,000 on the note, you are no longer able to make payments. The boat dealer repossesses the boat, which is now worth $11,000, and cancels the remaining balance ($3,000). Your adjusted basis in the boat is now $10,000 due to allowable depreciation deductions of $10,000. You will have ordinary income from cancellation of debt of $3,000 ($14,000 remaining debt owed minus $11,000 FMV of boat). You will have $1,000 of gain on disposition of the boat, the excess of the boat's FMV of $11,000 (the amount you realized on repossession) over your $10,000 adjusted basis in the boat. The facts are the same except that you signed a nonrecourse note when buying the boat. When the dealer repossesses the boat, you will have gain of $4,000, the difference between the $14,000 realized (the face amount of the remaining debt) and your $10,000 adjusted basis in the boat. You have no ordinary income from cancellation of the debt.

See Publication 4681 for detailed information on canceled debt and on reporting a gain or loss from repossession, foreclosure, or abandonment of property. See also Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets and Publication 523, Selling Your Home."|"If you borrow money and are legally obligated to repay a fixed or determinable amount at a future date, you have a debt. You may be personally liable for a debt or may own a property that secures a debt for which you may or may not also be personally liable.

If your debt is forgiven or discharged for less than the full amount owed, the debt is considered canceled for the forgiven or discharged amount that you no longer need to pay. Cancellation of a debt may occur if the creditor can't collect, or gives up on collecting, the amount you're obligated to pay. If you own property securing a debt, cancellation of the debt may occur due to foreclosure, repossession, voluntary transfer of the property to the lender, abandonment of the property, or a mortgage modification.

In general, if your debt is canceled, forgiven, or discharged for less than the amount owed, the amount of the canceled debt is taxable. If taxable, you must report the canceled debt on your tax return for the year in which the cancellation occurred.

However, the law provides several exceptions in which the discharged amount is not considered canceled debt. These exceptions will be discussed later.

After a debt is canceled, the creditor may send you a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt showing the amount canceled and date of cancellation. Contact the creditor if you receive a 1099-C reflecting incorrect information. If a creditor continues to attempt to collect the debt after you receive a 1099-C, the debt may not have been canceled and you may not have income from a canceled debt. Verify your specific situation with the creditor. Your responsibility to report the correct taxable amount of canceled debt as income on your tax return for the year in which the cancellation occurred remains, regardless of the accuracy of the Form 1099-C you received.

In general, you must report any taxable amount of a canceled debt as ordinary income on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return (attach Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Additional Income and Adjustments to IncomePDF ) if the debt is a nonbusiness debt, or on an applicable schedule if the debt is a business debt. See Publication 4681.

Caution: If your debt is secured by property, and the creditor takes that property in full or partial satisfaction of your debt, you are treated as having sold that property to the creditor. The tax treatment of the deemed sale depends on whether you were personally liable for the debt (recourse debt) or not personally liable for the debt (nonrecourse debt).

For recourse debt, your amount realized on the sale is the fair market value (FMV) of the property. The difference between FMV and your adjusted basis (usually your cost) will be a gain or loss on the disposition of the property. Your ordinary income from the cancellation of the debt is the amount by which the discharged debt exceeds the FMV of the property. Include this cancellation of debt in gross income unless an exception or exclusion, discussed below, applies.

For nonrecourse debt, your amount realized is the entire amount of the nonrecourse debt, plus the amount of cash and the FMV of any non-cash property you received. You will not have ordinary income resulting from debt cancellation.

The examples below show the difference between how recourse and nonrecourse debt is treated.

"content: Acquisition or abandonment of secured property

If you borrow money to purchase property, the lender may require the loan be secured by the purchased property. If you transfer ownership of the secured property to the lender, i.e., foreclosure, or if you abandon the property, the law may require you to treat the transfer or the abandonment as a sale of the property on which you have gain or loss. If the lender acquires the secured property, or has reason to know that you abandoned the secured property, the lender should send you a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property."|"Acquisition or abandonment of secured property

If you transfer ownership of the secured property to the lender, i.e., foreclosure, or if you abandon the property, the law may require you to treat the transfer or the abandonment as a sale of the property on which you have gain or loss. If the lender acquires the secured property, or has reason to know that you abandoned the secured property, the lender should send you a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property.

On Form 1099-A, the lender reports the amount of the debt owed (principal only) and the fair market value (FMV) of the secured property as of the date of the acquisition or abandonment of the property. You, the debtor, use the amount realized to determine a gain or loss on the disposition of the property and report the gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses and Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets if the property isn't used for business, or on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property if the property is used for business. If your property was subject to a debt for which you're personally liable (recourse debt), your amount realized is the FMV of the property. If your property was subject to a debt for which you're not personally liable (nonrecourse debt), your amount realized is the entire amount of the nonrecourse debt plus the amount of cash and the FMV of any property you received.

Cancellation of debt

When you borrow money, you don't include the loan proceeds in gross income because you have an obligation to repay the lender later. If the lender subsequently cancels that obligation, you may be required to include the amount of the canceled debt in gross income. A commercial lender canceling a debt will issue a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt to report the cancellation. On Form 1099-C, the lender reports the amount of the canceled debt.

If the lender's acquisition of the secured property (or the debtor's abandonment of the property) and the cancellation of the debt occur in the same calendar year, the lender may issue a Form 1099-C only. See Topic no. 431 for additional information on Form 1099-C.

Incorrect information

If you receive a Form 1099-A or Form 1099-C containing incorrect information, contact the lender to make corrections.

Excluding canceled debt from income"|"Acquisition or abandonment of secured property

If you borrow money to purchase property, the lender may require the loan be secured by the purchased property. If you transfer ownership of the secured property to the lender, i.e., foreclosure, or if you abandon the property, the law may require you to treat the transfer or the abandonment as a sale of the property on which you have gain or loss. If the lender acquires the secured property, or has reason to know that you abandoned the secured property, the lender should send you a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property.

On Form 1099-A, the lender reports the amount of the debt owed (principal only) and the fair market value (FMV) of the secured property as of the date of the acquisition or abandonment of the property. You, the debtor, use the amount realized to determine a gain or loss on the disposition of the property and report the gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses and Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets if the property isn't used for business, or on Form 4797, Sales of Business Property if the property is used for business. If your property was subject to a debt for which you're personally liable (recourse debt), your amount realized is the FMV of the property. If your property was subject to a debt for which you're not personally liable (nonrecourse debt), your amount realized is the entire amount of the nonrecourse debt plus the amount of cash and the FMV of any property you received. For more information, including information about the tax year in which you have an amount realized, refer to Publication 4681, Canceled Debts, Foreclosures, Repossessions, and Abandonments (for Individuals) and Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.

There are several different types of IRAs, including traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. You can set up an IRA with a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution.

Traditional IRAs

You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to a traditional IRA. You may also be eligible for a tax credit equal to a percentage of your contribution. Amounts in your traditional IRA, including earnings, generally aren't taxed until distributed to you. IRAs can't be owned jointly. However, any amounts remaining in your IRA upon your death will be paid to your beneficiary or beneficiaries.

Amounts in your traditional IRA, including earnings, generally aren't taxed until distributed to you. IRAs can't be owned jointly. However, any amounts remaining in your IRA upon your death will be paid to your beneficiary or beneficiaries.

Contributions

To contribute to a traditional IRA, you, and/or your spouse if you file a joint return, must have taxable compensation, such as wages, salaries, commissions, tips, bonuses, or net income from self-employment. For tax years beginning after 2019, there is no age limit to contribute to a traditional IRA. Compensation for purposes of contributing to an IRA doesn't include earnings and profits from property, such as rental income, interest and dividend income, or any amount received as pension or annuity income, or as deferred compensation. In certain cases, other amounts may be treated as compensation for purposes of contributing to an IRA, including certain alimony and separate maintenance payments received, certain amounts received to aid in the pursuit of graduate and postdoctoral studies, and certain difficulty of care payments received.

You can figure your allowable deduction using the worksheets in the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR)PDF or in Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) and claim your IRA deduction on Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors (attach Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Additional Income and Adjustments to IncomePDF). If you made nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA, you must attach Form 8606, Nondeductible IRAs.

Use Form 8880, Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contributions and Do I qualify for the retirement savings contributions credit? to determine whether you're also eligible for a tax credit. Enter the amount of the credit on Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR (attach Schedule 3 (Form 1040), Additional Credits and PaymentsPDF).

Distributions

Distributions from a traditional IRA are fully or partially taxable in the year of distribution. To determine if your IRA is taxable, see Is the distribution from my traditional, SEP or SIMPLE IRA taxable? If you made only deductible contributions, distributions are fully taxable. Use Form 8606 to figure the taxable portion of withdrawals when the traditional IRA contains nondeductible contributions.

IRA-to-IRA rollover limitation

You can only make one rollover from an IRA to another (or the same) IRA in any one-year period, regardless of the number of IRAs you own. A trustee-to-trustee transfer isn't a rollover and isn't affected by this rule. This rule also doesn't apply with respect to a conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

Early distributions

Distributions made prior to age 59½ may be subject to an additional 10% tax. You may also owe an excise tax if you don't begin to withdraw minimum distributions by April 1 of the year after the year you reach age 73 after 12/31/2022. These additional taxes are figured and reported on Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (Including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts. Refer to the Instructions for Form 5329PDF, Topic no. 557 and Do I meet an exception to the additional tax on early distributions from IRAs or retirement plans? for exceptions to the additional taxes.

Roth IRAs

A Roth IRA differs from a traditional IRA in several ways. Contributions to a Roth IRA aren't deductible (and you don't report the contributions on your tax return), but qualified distributions or distributions that are a return of contributions aren't subject to tax. To be a Roth IRA, the account or annuity must be designated as a Roth IRA when it's set up. For more information on Roth IRA contributions, refer to Topic no. 309 and to determine if a distribution from your Roth IRA is taxable, see Is the distribution from my Roth account taxable?

However, amounts the seller pays for points on your loan is treated as paid directly by you from unborrowed funds, provided you subtract the amount of the seller-paid points from your basis (purchase price) in your home. The points were computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage, and The amount shows clearly as points on your settlement statement.

"content: Whether you're self-employed or a partner, you may be able to deduct certain expenses for the part of your home that you use for business.

To deduct expenses for business use of the home, you must use part of your home as one of the following:

Exclusively on a regular basis as your principal place of business for your trade or business; Exclusively on a regular basis as a place where you meet or deal with your patients, clients, or customers in the normal course of your trade or business; A separate structure that's not attached to your home, used exclusively on a regular basis in connection with your trade or business; On a regular basis for storage of inventory or product samples used in your trade or business of selling products at retail or wholesale, so long as your home is the sole fixed location of such trade or business; For rental use; or As a daycare facility."|"Whether you're self-employed or a partner, you may be able to deduct certain expenses for the part of your home that you use for business.

If the exclusive use requirement applies, you can't deduct business expenses for any part of your home that you use both for personal and business purposes. For example, if you're an attorney and use the den of your home to write legal briefs and for personal purposes, you may not deduct any business use of your home expenses. Further, under the principal place of business test, you must determine that your home is the principal place of your trade or business after considering where you perform your most important business activities and where you spend most of your business activity time, in order to deduct expenses for the business use of your home. A portion of your home may qualify as your principal place of business if you use it for the administrative or management activities of your trade or business and have no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities for that trade or business.

You also may take deductions for business storage purposes when the dwelling unit is the sole fixed location of the business or for regular use of a residence for the provision of daycare services; exclusive use isn't required in these cases. For more information, see Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home (Including Use by Daycare Providers).

Deductible expenses for business use of your home include the business portion of real estate taxes, mortgage interest, rent, casualty losses, utilities, insurance, depreciation, maintenance, and repairs. In general, you may not deduct expenses for the parts of your home not used for business, for example, lawn care or painting a room not used for business.

Regular method - You compute the business use of home deduction by dividing expenses of operating the home between personal and business use. You may deduct direct business expenses in full, and may allocate the indirect total expenses of the home to the percentage of the home floor space used for business. A qualified daycare provider who doesn't use his or her home exclusively for business purposes, however, must figure the percentage based on the amount of time the applicable portion of the home is used for business. Self-employed taxpayers filing Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) first compute this deduction on Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home.

Simplified option - While taxpayers can still figure the deduction using the regular method, many taxpayers may find the optional safe harbor method less burdensome. Revenue Procedure 2013-13PDF allows qualifying taxpayers to use a prescribed rate of $5 per square foot of the portion of the home used for business (up to a maximum of 300 square feet) to compute the business use of home deduction. Under this safe harbor method, depreciation is treated as zero and the taxpayer claims the deduction directly on Schedule C (Form 1040). Instead of using Form 8829, the taxpayer indicates the taxpayer's election to use the safe harbor option by making two entries directly on the Schedule C for the square footage of the home and the square footage of the office. Deductions attributable to the home that are otherwise allowable without regard to business use (such as qualified residence interest, property taxes, and casualty losses) are allowed in full on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions. For more information, see Simplified Option for Home Office Deduction and FAQs – Simplified Method for Home Office Deduction.

Regardless of the method used to compute the deduction, you may not deduct business expenses in excess of the gross income limitation. Under the regular method for computing the deduction, you may be able to carry forward some of these business expenses to the next year, subject to the gross income limitation for that year. There's no carryover provision under the safe harbor method, but you may elect into and out of the safe harbor method in any given year.

In the farming business or a partner - If you're in the farming business and file Schedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming, or a partner and you're using actual expenses, use the ""Worksheet to Figure the Deduction for Business Use of Your Home"" to figure your deduction. If you're using the simplified method to figure the deduction, use the ""Simplified Method Worksheet"" to figure your deduction. Both worksheets are in Publication 587. Farmers claim their expenses on Schedule F (Form 1040)PDF. Partners generally claim their unreimbursed partnership expenses on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss.

You can generally figure the amount of your deductible car expense by using one of two methods: the standard mileage rate method or the actual expense method. If you qualify to use both methods, you may want to figure your deduction both ways before choosing a method to see which one gives you a larger deduction.

Standard mileage rate - For the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business, refer to Standard mileage rates or Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses. To use the standard mileage rate, you must own or lease the car and:

You must not operate five or more cars at the same time, as in a fleet operation,

You must not have claimed a depreciation deduction for the car using any method other than straight-line,

You must not have claimed a Section 179 deduction on the car,

You must not have claimed the special depreciation allowance on the car, and

You must not have claimed actual expenses after 1997 for a car you lease.

You must not have claimed actual expenses after 1997 for a car you lease.

To use the standard mileage rate for a car you own, you must choose to use it in the first year the car is available for use in your business. Then, in later years, you can choose to use the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.

For a car you lease, you must use the standard mileage rate method for the entire lease period (including renewals) if you choose the standard mileage rate.

Actual expenses - To use the actual expense method, you must determine what it actually costs to operate the car for the portion of the overall use of the car that's business use. Include gas, oil, repairs, tires, insurance, registration fees, licenses, and depreciation (or lease payments) attributable to the portion of the total miles driven that are business miles.

Note: Other car expenses for parking fees and tolls attributable to business use are separately deductible, whether you use the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.

Depreciation

Generally, the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) is the only depreciation method that can be used by car owners to depreciate any car placed in service after 1986. However, if you used the standard mileage rate in the year you place the car in service and change to the actual expense method in a later year and before your car is fully depreciated, you must use straight-line depreciation over the estimated remaining useful life of the car. There are limits on how much depreciation you can deduct. For additional information on the depreciation limits, please refer to Topic no. 704. Publication 463 explains the depreciation limits and discusses special rules applicable to leased cars.

Recordkeeping

The law requires that you substantiate your expenses by adequate records or by sufficient evidence to support your own statement. For further information on recordkeeping, refer to Topic no. 305.

You can generally figure the amount of your deductible car expense by using one of two methods: the standard mileage rate method or the actual expense method. If you qualify to use both methods, you may want to figure your deduction both ways before choosing a method to see which one gives you a larger deduction.

Standard mileage rate - For the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business, refer to Standard mileage rates or Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses. To use the standard mileage rate, you must own or lease the car and:

You must not operate five or more cars at the same time, as in a fleet operation,

You must not have claimed a depreciation deduction for the car using any method other than straight-line,

You must not have claimed a Section 179 deduction on the car,

You must not have claimed the special depreciation allowance on the car, and

"content: Travel expenses are the ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home for your business, profession, or job. You can't deduct expenses that are lavish or extravagant, or that are for personal purposes.

You're traveling away from home if your duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home for a period substantially longer than an ordinary day's work, and you need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away.

Generally, your tax home is the entire city or general area where your main place of business or work is located, regardless of where you maintain your family home. For example, you live with your family in Chicago but work in Milwaukee where you stay in a hotel and eat in restaurants. You return to Chicago every weekend. You may not deduct any of your travel, meals or lodging in Milwaukee because that's your tax home. Your travel on weekends to your family home in Chicago isn't for your work, so these expenses are also not deductible. If you regularly work in more than one place, your tax home is the general area where your main place of business or work is located."|"Travel expenses are the ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home for your business, profession, or job. You can't deduct expenses that are lavish or extravagant, or that are for personal purposes.

You're traveling away from home if your duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home for a period substantially longer than an ordinary day's work, and you need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away.

Generally, your tax home is the entire city or general area where your main place of business or work is located, regardless of where you maintain your family home. For example, you live with your family in Chicago but work in Milwaukee where you stay in a hotel and eat in restaurants. You return to Chicago every weekend. You may not deduct any of your travel, meals or lodging in Milwaukee because that's your tax home. Your travel on weekends to your family home in Chicago isn't for your work, so these expenses are also not deductible. If you regularly work in more than one place, your tax home is the general area where your main place of business or work is located.

In determining your main place of business, take into account the length of time you normally need to spend at each location for business purposes, the degree of business activity in each area, and the relative significance of the financial return from each area. However, the most important consideration is the length of time you spend at each location.

You can deduct travel expenses paid or incurred in connection with a temporary work assignment away from home. However, you can't deduct travel expenses paid in connection with an indefinite work assignment. Any work assignment in excess of one year is considered indefinite. Also, you may not deduct travel expenses at a work location if you realistically expect that you'll work there for more than one year, whether or not you actually work there that long. If you realistically expect to work at a temporary location for one year or less, and the expectation changes so that at some point you realistically expect to work there for more than one year, travel expenses become nondeductible when your expectation changes.

Travel expenses for conventions are deductible if you can show that your attendance benefits your trade or business. Special rules apply to conventions held outside the North American area.

Deductible travel expenses while away from home include, but aren't limited to, the costs of:

Travel by airplane, train, bus or car between your home and your business destination. (If you're provided with a ticket or you're riding free as a result of a frequent traveler or similar program, your cost is zero.) Fares for taxis or other types of transportation between: The airport or train station and your hotel,

The hotel and the work location of your customers or clients, your business meeting place, or your temporary work location. Shipping of baggage, and sample or display material between your regular and temporary work locations. Using your car while at your business destination. You can deduct actual expenses or the standard mileage rate, as well as business-related tolls and parking fees. If you rent a car, you can deduct only the business-use portion for the expenses. Lodging and non-entertainment-related meals. Dry cleaning and laundry. Business calls while on your business trip. (This includes business communications by fax machine or other communication devices.) Tips you pay for services related to any of these expenses. Other similar ordinary and necessary expenses related to your business travel. (These expenses might include transportation to and from a business meal, public stenographer's fees, computer rental fees, and operating and maintaining a house trailer.)

Instead of keeping records of your meal expenses and deducting the actual cost, you can generally use a standard meal allowance, which varies depending on where you travel. The deduction for business meals is generally limited to 50% of the unreimbursed cost.

If you're self-employed, you can deduct travel expenses on Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship), or if you're a farmer, on Schedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming.

If you're a member of the National Guard or military reserve, you may be able to claim a deduction for unreimbursed travel expenses paid in connection with the performance of services as a reservist that reduces your adjusted gross income. This travel must be overnight and more than 100 miles from your home. Expenses must be ordinary and necessary. This deduction is limited to the regular federal per diem rate (for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses) and the standard mileage rate (for car expenses) plus any parking fees, ferry fees, and tolls. Claim these expenses on Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses and report them on Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR as an adjustment to income.

You may not deduct casualty and theft losses covered by insurance, unless you file a timely claim for reimbursement and you reduce the loss by the amount of any reimbursement or expected reimbursement.

Casualty losses

A casualty loss can result from the damage, destruction, or loss of your property from any sudden, unexpected, or unusual event such as a flood, hurricane, tornado, fire, earthquake, or volcanic eruption. A casualty doesn't include normal wear and tear or progressive deterioration.

Federal casualty losses, disaster losses and qualified disaster losses are three categories of casualty losses that refer to federally declared disasters. The requirements for each loss vary. For more information, see Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts or refer to the Instructions for Form 4684.

If your property is business or income-producing property, such as rental property, and is completely destroyed, then the amount of your loss is your adjusted basis minus any salvage value or insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive.

Theft losses

A theft is the taking and removal of money or property with the intent to deprive the owner of it. The taking must be illegal under the law of the state where it occurred and must have been done with criminal intent. The amount of your theft loss is generally the adjusted basis of your property because the fair market value of your property immediately after the theft is considered to be zero.

Losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes - Special rules may apply to theft losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 4684PDF. Additionally, review Help for Victims of Ponzi Investment Schemes and Publication 547.

Insurance or other reimbursements

You must reduce the loss, whether it's a casualty or theft loss, by any salvage value and by any insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive. The adjusted basis of your property is usually your cost, increased or decreased by certain events such as improvements or depreciation. For more information about the basis of property, refer to Topic no. 703, Publication 547 and Publication 551, Basis of Assets. You may determine the decrease in fair market value by appraisal, or if certain conditions are met, by the cost of repairing the property. For more information, refer to Publication 547.

Capital gain

When the amount you receive from the insurance or other reimbursements is more than the cost or adjusted basis of the property you will typically, subject to a few exceptions for items like inventory, have a capital gain. You must ordinarily include the gain in your income, unless you're eligible to exclude or postpone reporting the capital gain. If you have a personal casualty capital gain for the tax year, you may be able to deduct the portion of the personal casualty loss not attributed to a federally declared disaster area to the extent the loss doesn't exceed the personal capital gain. For more information, refer to Publication 547.

Claiming the loss

Individuals may claim their casualty and theft losses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions (or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR)PDF, if you're a nonresident alien). For property held by you for personal use, you must subtract $100 from each casualty or theft event that occurred during the year after you've subtracted any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement. Then add up all those amounts and subtract 10% of your adjusted gross income from that total to calculate your allowable casualty and theft losses for the year.

If you have a qualified disaster loss you may elect to deduct the loss without itemizing your deductions. Your net casualty loss doesn't need to exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income to qualify for the deduction, but you would reduce each casualty loss by $500 after any salvage value and any other reimbursement. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) or Instructions for Form 1040-NR and Publication 547.

Report casualty and theft losses on Form 4684, Casualties and TheftsPDF . Use Section A for personal-use property and Section B for business or income-producing property. If personal-use property was damaged, destroyed or stolen, you may wish to refer to Publication 584, Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook (Personal-Use Property). For losses involving business-use property, refer to Publication 584-B, Business Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook. These workbooks are helpful in claiming the losses on Form 4684; keep them with your tax records.

When to deduct

Casualty losses are deductible in the year you sustain the loss, which is generally in the year the casualty occurred. You have not sustained a loss if you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement. If you have a casualty loss from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance (or both), you can choose to treat the casualty loss as having occurred in the year immediately preceding the tax year in which you sustained the disaster loss, and you can deduct the loss on your return or amended return for that preceding tax year. See Revenue Procedure 2016-53 for guidance on the time and manner of making and revoking an election under Code Section 165(i). Review Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses for information regarding timeframes and additional information to your specific qualifying event.

Theft losses are generally deductible in the year you discover the property was stolen unless you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement. In that case, no deduction is available until the taxable year in which you can determine with reasonable certainty whether or not you'll receive such reimbursement.

When your loss deduction exceeds your income

If your deductions, including your loss deduction, are more than your income, you may have a net operating loss (NOL). You don't have to be in business to have an NOL from a casualty.

You may determine the decrease in fair market value by appraisal, or if certain conditions are met, by the cost of repairing the property. For more information, refer to Publication 547.

Capital gain

When the amount you receive from the insurance or other reimbursements is more than the cost or adjusted basis of the property you will typically, subject to a few exceptions for items like inventory, have a capital gain. You must ordinarily include the gain in your income, unless you're eligible to exclude or postpone reporting the capital gain. If you have a personal casualty capital gain for the tax year, you may be able to deduct the portion of the personal casualty loss not attributed to a federally declared disaster area to the extent the loss doesn't exceed the personal capital gain. For more information, refer to Publication 547.

Claiming the loss

Individuals may claim their casualty and theft losses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions (or Schedule A (Form 1040-NR)PDF, if you're a nonresident alien). For property held by you for personal use, you must subtract $100 from each casualty or theft event that occurred during the year after you've subtracted any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement. Then add up all those amounts and subtract 10% of your adjusted gross income from that total to calculate your allowable casualty and theft losses for the year.

If you have a qualified disaster loss you may elect to deduct the loss without itemizing your deductions. Your net casualty loss doesn't need to exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income to qualify for the deduction, but you would reduce each casualty loss by $500 after any salvage value and any other reimbursement. For more information, see the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) or Instructions for Form 1040-NR and Publication 547.

Report casualty and theft losses on Form 4684, Casualties and TheftsPDF . Use Section A for personal-use property and Section B for business or income-producing property. If personal-use property was damaged, destroyed or stolen, you may wish to refer to Publication 584, Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook (Personal-Use Property). For losses involving business-use property, refer to Publication 584-B, Business Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook. These workbooks are helpful in claiming the losses on Form 4684; keep them with your tax records.

When to deduct

Casualty losses are deductible in the year you sustain the loss, which is generally in the year the casualty occurred. You have not sustained a loss if you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement. If you have a casualty loss from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance (or both), you can choose to treat the casualty loss as having occurred in the year immediately preceding the tax year in which you sustained the disaster loss, and you can deduct the loss on your return or amended return for that preceding tax year. See Revenue Procedure 2016-53 for guidance on the time and manner of making and revoking an election under Code Section 165(i). Review Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses for information regarding timeframes and additional information to your specific qualifying event.

Theft losses are generally deductible in the year you discover the property was stolen unless you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement. In that case, no deduction is available until the taxable year in which you can determine with reasonable certainty whether or not you'll receive such reimbursement.

When your loss deduction exceeds your income

If your deductions, including your loss deduction, are more than your income, you may have a net operating loss (NOL). You don't have to be in business to have an NOL from a casualty. For more information, refer to Publication 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts."|78|itemized deductions|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc515|7393b86ae14c47f0a5a5272300dec176

When to deduct"|"Generally, you may deduct casualty and theft losses relating to your home, household items, and vehicles on your federal income tax return if the loss is caused by a federally declared disaster. You may not deduct casualty and theft losses covered by insurance, unless you file a timely claim for reimbursement and you reduce the loss by the amount of any reimbursement or expected reimbursement.

Casualty losses

A casualty loss can result from the damage, destruction, or loss of your property from any sudden, unexpected, or unusual event such as a flood, hurricane, tornado, fire, earthquake, or volcanic eruption. A casualty doesn't include normal wear and tear or progressive deterioration.

Federal casualty losses, disaster losses and qualified disaster losses are three categories of casualty losses that refer to federally declared disasters. The requirements for each loss vary. For more information, see Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts or refer to the Instructions for Form 4684.

If your property is personal-use property or isn't completely destroyed, the amount of your casualty loss is the lesser of:

The adjusted basis of your property, or

The decrease in fair market value of your property as a result of the casualty

If your property is business or income-producing property, such as rental property, and is completely destroyed, then the amount of your loss is your adjusted basis minus any salvage value or insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive.

Theft losses

A theft is the taking and removal of money or property with the intent to deprive the owner of it. The taking must be illegal under the law of the state where it occurred and must have been done with criminal intent. The amount of your theft loss is generally the adjusted basis of your property because the fair market value of your property immediately after the theft is considered to be zero.

Losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes - Special rules may apply to theft losses from Ponzi-type investment schemes. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 4684PDF. Additionally, review Help for Victims of Ponzi Investment Schemes and Publication 547.

Insurance or other reimbursements

You must reduce the loss, whether it's a casualty or theft loss, by any salvage value and by any insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive. The adjusted basis of your property is usually your cost, increased or decreased by certain events such as improvements or depreciation. For more information about the basis of property, refer to Topic no. 703, Publication 547 and Publication 551, Basis of Assets.

Optional methods

If you had a loss or small amount of income from your self-employment, it may be to your benefit to use one of the two optional methods to compute your net earnings from self-employment. Refer to the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040)PDF to see if you qualify to use an optional method. An optional method may give you credit toward your Social Security coverage or increase your earned income credit or the child and dependent care credit.

Church employee

As an employee of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that elected exemption from Social Security and Medicare taxes, you must pay self-employment tax if the church or qualified church-controlled organization paid you more than $108.28, unless you are personally exempt from self-employment tax. If you're required to pay self-employment tax, attach Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax and Schedule 2 (Form 1040), Additional TaxesPDF to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. For more information on church-related income and self-employment taxes, refer to Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers.

Self-employment tax rate

The law sets the self-employment tax rate as a percentage of your net earnings from self-employment. This rate consists of 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare taxes.

Additional Medicare tax

Additional Medicare tax applies to self-employment income above a threshold. The threshold amounts are $250,000 for a married individual filing a joint return, $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, and $200,000 for all others. For additional information, refer to the Instructions for Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

Reporting self-employment tax

Compute self-employment tax on Schedule SE (Form 1040). When figuring your adjusted gross income on Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR, you can deduct one-half of the self-employment tax.

"Optional methods

If you had a loss or small amount of income from your self-employment, it may be to your benefit to use one of the two optional methods to compute your net earnings from self-employment. Refer to the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040)PDF to see if you qualify to use an optional method. An optional method may give you credit toward your Social Security coverage or increase your earned income credit or the child and dependent care credit.

Church employee

As an employee of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that elected exemption from Social Security and Medicare taxes, you must pay self-employment tax if the church or qualified church-controlled organization paid you more than $108.28, unless you are personally exempt from self-employment tax. If you're required to pay self-employment tax, attach Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax and Schedule 2 (Form 1040), Additional TaxesPDF to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. For more information on church-related income and self-employment taxes, refer to Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers.

Self-employment tax rate

The law sets the self-employment tax rate as a percentage of your net earnings from self-employment. This rate consists of 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare taxes."|"You're self-employed for this purpose if you're a sole proprietor (including an independent contractor), a partner in a partnership (including a member of a multi-member limited liability company (LLC) that is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes) or are otherwise in business for yourself. The term sole proprietor also includes the member of a single member LLC that's disregarded for federal income tax purposes and a member of a qualified joint venture. You usually must pay self-employment tax if you had net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more. Generally, the amount subject to self-employment tax is 92.35% of your net earnings from self-employment. You calculate net earnings by subtracting ordinary and necessary trade or business expenses from the gross income you derived from your trade or business. You can be liable for paying self-employment tax even if you currently receive Social Security benefits. The law sets a maximum amount of net earnings subject to the Social Security tax. This amount changes annually. All of your net earnings are subject to the Medicare tax.

"content: Under the tax law, certain tax benefits can significantly reduce a taxpayer's regular tax amount. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) applies to taxpayers with high economic income by setting a limit on those benefits. It helps to ensure that those taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax.

How is the AMT calculated?

The AMT is the excess of the tentative minimum tax over the regular tax. Thus, the AMT is owed only if the tentative minimum tax for the year is greater than the regular tax for that year. The tentative minimum tax is figured separately from the regular tax. In general, compute the tentative minimum tax by:

Computing taxable income eliminating or reducing certain exclusions and deductions, and taking into account differences with respect to when certain items are used to compute regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), Subtracting the AMT exemption amount, Multiplying the amount computed in (2) by the appropriate AMT tax rates, and Subtracting the AMT foreign tax credit.

The law sets the AMT exemption amounts and AMT tax rates. Taxpayers can use the special capital gain rates in effect for the regular tax if they're lower than the AMT tax rates that would otherwise apply. In addition, some tax credits that reduce regular tax liability don't reduce AMT tax liability.

Am I subject to the AMT?"|"Under the tax law, certain tax benefits can significantly reduce a taxpayer's regular tax amount.

For more information or to see if you qualify, see Publication 596, Earned Income Credit and visit Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)."|"You may qualify for the earned income tax credit (EITC) if you worked last year but earned a low or moderate income. EITC is a refundable tax credit, which means that even if you don't owe any tax, you can still receive a refund.

To qualify for the credit, your adjusted gross income (AGI) must be below a certain amount, and you must:

Have a Social Security number (SSN) valid for employment (if you're filing a joint return, your spouse also must have an SSN valid for employment) by the due date of your return (including extensions). If you don't have an SSN by the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC on either an original or an amended return, even if you later get an SSN. Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC (Form 1040) also must have an SSN valid for employment by the due date of your return (including extensions). If a child didn't have an SSN by the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying child in figuring the EIC on either your original or an amended return, even if that child later gets an SSN. Singles and married couples who have SSNs can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they would get the smaller credit available to childless workers.

Have a filing status other than married filing separately. Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To qualify, the spouse claiming the credit cannot file jointly with the other spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the other spouse for the last six months of the year and must have a qualifying child living with him or her for more than half the year.

"content: You may be able to claim the child and dependent care credit if you paid expenses for the care of a qualifying individual to enable you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) to work or actively look for work. Generally, you may not take this credit if your filing status is married filing separately. However, see What's Your Filing Status? in Publication 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements. The amount of the credit is a percentage of the amount of work-related expenses you paid to a care provider for the care of a qualifying individual. The percentage depends on your adjusted gross income.

Dollar limit

The total expenses that you may use to calculate the credit may not be more than $3,000 (for one qualifying individual) or $6,000 (for two or more qualifying individuals). Expenses paid for the care of a qualifying individual are eligible expenses if the primary reason for paying the expense is to assure the individual's well-being and protection. If you received dependent care benefits that you exclude or deduct from your income, you must subtract the amount of those benefits from the dollar limit that applies to you.

Your dependent qualifying child who was under age 13 when the care was provided,

Your spouse who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care and lived with you for more than half of the year, or

An individual who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care, lived with you for more than half of the year, and either: (a) was your dependent; or (b) could have been your dependent except that he or she received gross income of $4,700 or more, or filed a joint return, or you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) could have been claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's 2023 return.

Physically or mentally not able to care for oneself - An individual is physically or mentally incapable of self-care if, as a result of a physical or mental defect, the individual is incapable of caring for his or her hygiene or nutritional needs or requires the full-time attention of another person for the individual's own safety or the safety of others.

Children of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart - A noncustodial parent who is claiming a child as a dependent should review the rules under the topic Child of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart in Publication 503, because a child may be treated as the qualifying individual of the custodial parent for the child and dependent care credit, even if the noncustodial parent is entitled to claim the child as a dependent.

Individual qualifying for part of year - If an individual is a qualifying individual for only a part of the tax year, only those expenses paid for care of the individual during that part of the year are included in calculating the credit.

Taxpayer identification number (TIN) - You must provide the TIN (usually the Social Security number) of each qualifying individual.

Care of a qualifying individual

The care may be provided in the household or outside the household; however, don't include any amounts that aren't primarily for the well-being of the individual. You should divide the expenses between amounts that are primarily for the care of the individual and amounts that aren't primarily for the care of the individual. You must reduce the expenses primarily for the care of the individual by the amount of any dependent care benefits provided by your employer that you exclude from gross income. In general, you can exclude up to $5,000 for dependent care benefits received from your employer. Additionally, in general, the expenses claimed may not exceed the smaller of your earned income or your spouse's earned income. If you or your spouse is a full-time student or incapable of self-care, then you or your spouse is treated as having earned income for each month that you or your spouse is a full-time student or incapable of self-care. Your or your spouse's earned income for each month is $250 if there is one qualifying person ($500 if two or more qualifying individuals). See the topic Earned Income Limit in Publication 503PDF for further information.

Care providers

You must identify all persons or organizations that provide care for your child or dependent. You must report the name, address, and TIN (either the Social Security number or the employer identification number) of the care provider on your return. If the care provider is a tax-exempt organization, you need only report the name and address of the organization on your return. You can use Form W-10, Dependent Care Provider's Identification and Certification to request this information from the care provider. If you can't provide information regarding the care provider, you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required information. If you pay a provider to care for your dependent or spouse in your home, you may be a household employer. If you're a household employer, you may have to withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes and pay federal unemployment tax. For more information, refer to Do You Have Household Employees? in Publication 503, Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide, or Topic no. 756.

Payments to relatives or dependents - The care provider can't be your spouse, the parent of your qualifying individual if your qualifying individual is your child and under age 13, your child who is under the age of 19, or a dependent whom you or your spouse may claim on your return.

Reporting on your tax return

If you qualify for the credit, complete Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses and attach to Form 1040, U.S Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return.

For more information, refer to Do You Have Household Employees? in Publication 503, Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide, or Topic no. 756.

Payments to relatives or dependents - The care provider can't be your spouse, the parent of your qualifying individual if your qualifying individual is your child and under age 13, your child who is under the age of 19, or a dependent whom you or your spouse may claim on your return.

Reporting on your tax return"|"You may be able to claim the child and dependent care credit if you paid expenses for the care of a qualifying individual to enable you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) to work or actively look for work. Generally, you may not take this credit if your filing status is married filing separately. However, see What's Your Filing Status? in Publication 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements. The amount of the credit is a percentage of the amount of work-related expenses you paid to a care provider for the care of a qualifying individual. The percentage depends on your adjusted gross income.

Dollar limit

The total expenses that you may use to calculate the credit may not be more than $3,000 (for one qualifying individual) or $6,000 (for two or more qualifying individuals). Expenses paid for the care of a qualifying individual are eligible expenses if the primary reason for paying the expense is to assure the individual's well-being and protection. If you received dependent care benefits that you exclude or deduct from your income, you must subtract the amount of those benefits from the dollar limit that applies to you.

Qualifying individual

A qualifying individual for the child and dependent care credit is:

Your dependent qualifying child who was under age 13 when the care was provided,

Your spouse who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care and lived with you for more than half of the year, or

An individual who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care, lived with you for more than half of the year, and either: (a) was your dependent; or (b) could have been your dependent except that he or she received gross income of $4,700 or more, or filed a joint return, or you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) could have been claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's 2023 return.

Physically or mentally not able to care for oneself - An individual is physically or mentally incapable of self-care if, as a result of a physical or mental defect, the individual is incapable of caring for his or her hygiene or nutritional needs or requires the full-time attention of another person for the individual's own safety or the safety of others.

Children of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart - A noncustodial parent who is claiming a child as a dependent should review the rules under the topic Child of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart in Publication 503, because a child may be treated as the qualifying individual of the custodial parent for the child and dependent care credit, even if the noncustodial parent is entitled to claim the child as a dependent.

Individual qualifying for part of year - If an individual is a qualifying individual for only a part of the tax year, only those expenses paid for care of the individual during that part of the year are included in calculating the credit.

Taxpayer identification number (TIN) - You must provide the TIN (usually the Social Security number) of each qualifying individual.

Care of a qualifying individual

The care may be provided in the household or outside the household; however, don't include any amounts that aren't primarily for the well-being of the individual. You should divide the expenses between amounts that are primarily for the care of the individual and amounts that aren't primarily for the care of the individual. You must reduce the expenses primarily for the care of the individual by the amount of any dependent care benefits provided by your employer that you exclude from gross income. In general, you can exclude up to $5,000 for dependent care benefits received from your employer. Additionally, in general, the expenses claimed may not exceed the smaller of your earned income or your spouse's earned income. If you or your spouse is a full-time student or incapable of self-care, then you or your spouse is treated as having earned income for each month that you or your spouse is a full-time student or incapable of self-care. Your or your spouse's earned income for each month is $250 if there is one qualifying person ($500 if two or more qualifying individuals). See the topic Earned Income Limit in Publication 503PDF for further information.

Care providers

You must identify all persons or organizations that provide care for your child or dependent. You must report the name, address, and TIN (either the Social Security number or the employer identification number) of the care provider on your return. If the care provider is a tax-exempt organization, you need only report the name and address of the organization on your return. You can use Form W-10, Dependent Care Provider's Identification and Certification to request this information from the care provider. If you can't provide information regarding the care provider, you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required information. If you pay a provider to care for your dependent or spouse in your home, you may be a household employer. If you're a household employer, you may have to withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes and pay federal unemployment tax. For more information, refer to Do You Have Household Employees? in Publication 503, Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide, or Topic no. 756.

Payments to relatives or dependents - The care provider can't be your spouse, the parent of your qualifying individual if your qualifying individual is your child and under age 13, your child who is under the age of 19, or a dependent whom you or your spouse may claim on your return.

Reporting on your tax return

If you qualify for the credit, complete Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses and attach to Form 1040, U.S Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. If you received dependent care benefits from your employer (an amount is shown on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement), you must complete Part III of Form 2441.

Qualifying individual

A qualifying individual for the child and dependent care credit is:

Your dependent qualifying child who was under age 13 when the care was provided,

Your spouse who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care and lived with you for more than half of the year, or

An individual who was physically or mentally incapable of self-care, lived with you for more than half of the year, and either: (a) was your dependent; or (b) could have been your dependent except that he or she received gross income of $4,700 or more, or filed a joint return, or you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) could have been claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's 2023 return.

Physically or mentally not able to care for oneself - An individual is physically or mentally incapable of self-care if, as a result of a physical or mental defect, the individual is incapable of caring for his or her hygiene or nutritional needs or requires the full-time attention of another person for the individual's own safety or the safety of others.

Children of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart - A noncustodial parent who is claiming a child as a dependent should review the rules under the topic Child of divorced or separated parents or parents living apart in Publication 503, because a child may be treated as the qualifying individual of the custodial parent for the child and dependent care credit, even if the noncustodial parent is entitled to claim the child as a dependent.

Individual qualifying for part of year - If an individual is a qualifying individual for only a part of the tax year, only those expenses paid for care of the individual during that part of the year are included in calculating the credit.

Taxpayer identification number (TIN) - You must provide the TIN (usually the Social Security number) of each qualifying individual.

Care of a qualifying individual

The care may be provided in the household or outside the household; however, don't include any amounts that aren't primarily for the well-being of the individual. You should divide the expenses between amounts that are primarily for the care of the individual and amounts that aren't primarily for the care of the individual.

"content: Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance. The credit is nonrefundable, which means it's limited to your tax liability for the year. However, any credit in excess of your tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years. The maximum amount (dollar limit) for 2023 is $15,950 per child.

Qualified adoption expenses

For both the credit and the exclusion, qualified adoption expenses, defined in section 23(d)(1) of the Code, include:

Reasonable and necessary adoption fees,

Court costs and attorney fees,

Traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and

Other expenses that are directly related to and for the principal purpose of the legal adoption of an eligible child.

An expense may be a qualified adoption expense even if the expense is paid before an eligible child has been identified. For example, prospective adoptive parents who pay for a home study at the outset of an adoption effort may treat the fees as qualified adoption expenses.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse."|"Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse.

Qualified adoption expenses include expenses paid by a registered domestic partner who lives in a state that allows a second parent or co-parent to adopt their partner's child, as long as those expenses otherwise qualify for the credit.

Income and dollar limitations

The credit and exclusion are each subject to an income limitation and a dollar limitation. The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If your MAGI amount for 2023 falls between certain dollar limits, your credit or exclusion is subject to a phaseout (is reduced or eliminated). For tax year 2023, the MAGI phaseout begins at $239,230 and ends at $279,230. Thus, if your MAGI amount is below $239,230 for 2023, your credit or exclusion won't be affected by the MAGI phaseout, whereas if your MAGI amount for 2023 is $279,230 or more, your credit or exclusion will be zero.

You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed).

The dollar limitation applies separately to both the credit and the exclusion, and you may be able to claim both the credit and the exclusion for qualified expenses. However, you must claim any allowable exclusion before claiming any allowable credit. Expenses used for the exclusion reduce the amount of qualified adoption expenses available for the credit. As a result, you can't claim both a credit and an exclusion for the same expenses. Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these rules.

Example 1. In 2023, the following events occur: (a) You pay $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in connection with an adoption of an eligible child; (b) your employer reimburses you for $5,950 of those expenses; and (3) the adoption becomes final. Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

Filing status

To determine your filing status, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information and What is my filing status?

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

Form 8839 and instructions

To claim the adoption credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses and attach the form to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The Instructions for Form 8839 contain additional information about the adoption credit and exclusion. Also, visit Am I eligible to claim a credit for adopting a child or to exclude employer-provided adoption benefits from my employer? You're no longer required to attach the adoption documentation with your tax return; however, you must keep the documentation as part of your records. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file their federal income tax returns. Form 8839 can be e-filed with Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR. Consequently, taxpayers who e-file their tax returns need not print and mail completed forms to the IRS."|90|tax credits|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607|43e96ad2eb5c4171a2820f8cde1252f7

Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

Filing status

To determine your filing status, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information and What is my filing status?

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

Form 8839 and instructions

To claim the adoption credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses and attach the form to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The Instructions for Form 8839 contain additional information about the adoption credit and exclusion. Also, visit Am I eligible to claim a credit for adopting a child or to exclude employer-provided adoption benefits from my employer? You're no longer required to attach the adoption documentation with your tax return; however, you must keep the documentation as part of your records. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file their federal income tax returns. Form 8839 can be e-filed with Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR. Consequently, taxpayers who e-file their tax returns need not print and mail completed forms to the IRS."|90|tax credits|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607|81867770e85b4b56bd4e3546890ab280
"You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed)."|"Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance. The credit is nonrefundable, which means it's limited to your tax liability for the year. However, any credit in excess of your tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years. The maximum amount (dollar limit) for 2023 is $15,950 per child.

Qualified adoption expenses

For both the credit and the exclusion, qualified adoption expenses, defined in section 23(d)(1) of the Code, include:

Reasonable and necessary adoption fees,

Court costs and attorney fees,

Traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and

Other expenses that are directly related to and for the principal purpose of the legal adoption of an eligible child.

An expense may be a qualified adoption expense even if the expense is paid before an eligible child has been identified. For example, prospective adoptive parents who pay for a home study at the outset of an adoption effort may treat the fees as qualified adoption expenses.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse.

Qualified adoption expenses include expenses paid by a registered domestic partner who lives in a state that allows a second parent or co-parent to adopt their partner's child, as long as those expenses otherwise qualify for the credit.

Income and dollar limitations

The credit and exclusion are each subject to an income limitation and a dollar limitation. The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If your MAGI amount for 2023 falls between certain dollar limits, your credit or exclusion is subject to a phaseout (is reduced or eliminated). For tax year 2023, the MAGI phaseout begins at $239,230 and ends at $279,230. Thus, if your MAGI amount is below $239,230 for 2023, your credit or exclusion won't be affected by the MAGI phaseout, whereas if your MAGI amount for 2023 is $279,230 or more, your credit or exclusion will be zero.

You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed).

The dollar limitation applies separately to both the credit and the exclusion, and you may be able to claim both the credit and the exclusion for qualified expenses. However, you must claim any allowable exclusion before claiming any allowable credit. Expenses used for the exclusion reduce the amount of qualified adoption expenses available for the credit. As a result, you can't claim both a credit and an exclusion for the same expenses. Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these rules.

Example 1. In 2023, the following events occur: (a) You pay $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in connection with an adoption of an eligible child; (b) your employer reimburses you for $5,950 of those expenses; and (3) the adoption becomes final. Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

Filing status

To determine your filing status, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information and What is my filing status?

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

Form 8839 and instructions

To claim the adoption credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses and attach the form to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The Instructions for Form 8839 contain additional information about the adoption credit and exclusion. Also, visit Am I eligible to claim a credit for adopting a child or to exclude employer-provided adoption benefits from my employer? You're no longer required to attach the adoption documentation with your tax return; however, you must keep the documentation as part of your records. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file their federal income tax returns. Form 8839 can be e-filed with Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR. Consequently, taxpayers who e-file their tax returns need not print and mail completed forms to the IRS."|90|tax credits|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607|a48d66dce336446c9c59b96bee6b4a4e
"Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified)."|"Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance. The credit is nonrefundable, which means it's limited to your tax liability for the year. However, any credit in excess of your tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years. The maximum amount (dollar limit) for 2023 is $15,950 per child.

Qualified adoption expenses

For both the credit and the exclusion, qualified adoption expenses, defined in section 23(d)(1) of the Code, include:

Reasonable and necessary adoption fees,

Court costs and attorney fees,

Traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and

Other expenses that are directly related to and for the principal purpose of the legal adoption of an eligible child.

An expense may be a qualified adoption expense even if the expense is paid before an eligible child has been identified. For example, prospective adoptive parents who pay for a home study at the outset of an adoption effort may treat the fees as qualified adoption expenses.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse.

Qualified adoption expenses include expenses paid by a registered domestic partner who lives in a state that allows a second parent or co-parent to adopt their partner's child, as long as those expenses otherwise qualify for the credit.

Income and dollar limitations

The credit and exclusion are each subject to an income limitation and a dollar limitation. The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If your MAGI amount for 2023 falls between certain dollar limits, your credit or exclusion is subject to a phaseout (is reduced or eliminated). For tax year 2023, the MAGI phaseout begins at $239,230 and ends at $279,230. Thus, if your MAGI amount is below $239,230 for 2023, your credit or exclusion won't be affected by the MAGI phaseout, whereas if your MAGI amount for 2023 is $279,230 or more, your credit or exclusion will be zero.

You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed).

The dollar limitation applies separately to both the credit and the exclusion, and you may be able to claim both the credit and the exclusion for qualified expenses. However, you must claim any allowable exclusion before claiming any allowable credit. Expenses used for the exclusion reduce the amount of qualified adoption expenses available for the credit. As a result, you can't claim both a credit and an exclusion for the same expenses. Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these rules.

Example 1. In 2023, the following events occur: (a) You pay $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in connection with an adoption of an eligible child; (b) your employer reimburses you for $5,950 of those expenses; and (3) the adoption becomes final. Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

Filing status

To determine your filing status, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information and What is my filing status?

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

Form 8839 and instructions

To claim the adoption credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses and attach the form to your Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. The Instructions for Form 8839 contain additional information about the adoption credit and exclusion. Also, visit Am I eligible to claim a credit for adopting a child or to exclude employer-provided adoption benefits from my employer? You're no longer required to attach the adoption documentation with your tax return; however, you must keep the documentation as part of your records. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file their federal income tax returns. Form 8839 can be e-filed with Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR. Consequently, taxpayers who e-file their tax returns need not print and mail completed forms to the IRS."|90|tax credits|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607|aa78764473814687bf60e5d2ebf75af2
"If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs"|"Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance. The credit is nonrefundable, which means it's limited to your tax liability for the year. However, any credit in excess of your tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years. The maximum amount (dollar limit) for 2023 is $15,950 per child.

Qualified adoption expenses

For both the credit and the exclusion, qualified adoption expenses, defined in section 23(d)(1) of the Code, include:

Reasonable and necessary adoption fees,

Court costs and attorney fees,

Traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and

Other expenses that are directly related to and for the principal purpose of the legal adoption of an eligible child.

An expense may be a qualified adoption expense even if the expense is paid before an eligible child has been identified. For example, prospective adoptive parents who pay for a home study at the outset of an adoption effort may treat the fees as qualified adoption expenses.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse.

Qualified adoption expenses include expenses paid by a registered domestic partner who lives in a state that allows a second parent or co-parent to adopt their partner's child, as long as those expenses otherwise qualify for the credit.

Income and dollar limitations

The credit and exclusion are each subject to an income limitation and a dollar limitation. The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If your MAGI amount for 2023 falls between certain dollar limits, your credit or exclusion is subject to a phaseout (is reduced or eliminated). For tax year 2023, the MAGI phaseout begins at $239,230 and ends at $279,230. Thus, if your MAGI amount is below $239,230 for 2023, your credit or exclusion won't be affected by the MAGI phaseout, whereas if your MAGI amount for 2023 is $279,230 or more, your credit or exclusion will be zero.

You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed).

The dollar limitation applies separately to both the credit and the exclusion, and you may be able to claim both the credit and the exclusion for qualified expenses. However, you must claim any allowable exclusion before claiming any allowable credit. Expenses used for the exclusion reduce the amount of qualified adoption expenses available for the credit. As a result, you can't claim both a credit and an exclusion for the same expenses. Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these rules.

Example 1. In 2023, the following events occur: (a) You pay $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in connection with an adoption of an eligible child; (b) your employer reimburses you for $5,950 of those expenses; and (3) the adoption becomes final. Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit.

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years.

On the 2023 tax return they file married filing jointly and only $9,000 ($4,000 paid in 2022 and $5,000 paid in 2023) of the expenses qualify for 2023. Since they filed married filing separately in 2022 and the $3,000 paid in 2021 is first allowable for 2022, they can't claim the adoption credit for those expenses unless they change their filing status to married filing jointly for 2022.

"Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

Example 5. Husband and wife pay qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the domestic adoption becomes final. They have filed married filing separately for all prior tax years."|"Tax benefits for adoption include both a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses paid to adopt an eligible child and an exclusion from income for employer-provided adoption assistance. The credit is nonrefundable, which means it's limited to your tax liability for the year. However, any credit in excess of your tax liability may be carried forward for up to five years. The maximum amount (dollar limit) for 2023 is $15,950 per child.

Qualified adoption expenses

For both the credit and the exclusion, qualified adoption expenses, defined in section 23(d)(1) of the Code, include:

Reasonable and necessary adoption fees,

Court costs and attorney fees,

Traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and

Other expenses that are directly related to and for the principal purpose of the legal adoption of an eligible child.

An expense may be a qualified adoption expense even if the expense is paid before an eligible child has been identified. For example, prospective adoptive parents who pay for a home study at the outset of an adoption effort may treat the fees as qualified adoption expenses.

An eligible child is an individual who is under the age of 18 or is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

Qualified adoption expenses don't include expenses that a taxpayer pays to adopt the child of the taxpayer's spouse.

Qualified adoption expenses include expenses paid by a registered domestic partner who lives in a state that allows a second parent or co-parent to adopt their partner's child, as long as those expenses otherwise qualify for the credit.

Income and dollar limitations

The credit and exclusion are each subject to an income limitation and a dollar limitation. The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). If your MAGI amount for 2023 falls between certain dollar limits, your credit or exclusion is subject to a phaseout (is reduced or eliminated). For tax year 2023, the MAGI phaseout begins at $239,230 and ends at $279,230. Thus, if your MAGI amount is below $239,230 for 2023, your credit or exclusion won't be affected by the MAGI phaseout, whereas if your MAGI amount for 2023 is $279,230 or more, your credit or exclusion will be zero.

You must reduce the dollar limit for a particular year by the amount of qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in previous years for the same adoption effort. For example, if you claimed a $3,000 credit in connection with a domestic adoption in 2022 and paid an additional $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in 2023 (when the adoption became final), the maximum credit you can claim in 2023 is $12,950 ($15,950 dollar limit less $3,000 of qualified adoption expenses claimed in 2022).

In computing the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid and claimed in connection with an unsuccessful domestic adoption effort must be combined with qualified adoption expenses paid in connection with a subsequent domestic adoption attempt, whether or not the subsequent attempt is successful. For example, assume that in 2021 an individual claimed $8,000 in qualified adoption expenses in an unsuccessful adoption effort. In 2022 and 2023 the individual spent a total of $10,000 in qualified adoption expenses in connection with a successful domestic adoption that became final in 2023. The maximum adoption credit allowable in 2023 is $7,950 ($15,950 dollar limit for 2023 less $8,000 previously claimed).

The dollar limitation applies separately to both the credit and the exclusion, and you may be able to claim both the credit and the exclusion for qualified expenses. However, you must claim any allowable exclusion before claiming any allowable credit. Expenses used for the exclusion reduce the amount of qualified adoption expenses available for the credit. As a result, you can't claim both a credit and an exclusion for the same expenses. Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these rules.

Example 1. In 2023, the following events occur: (a) You pay $15,950 of qualified adoption expenses in connection with an adoption of an eligible child; (b) your employer reimburses you for $5,950 of those expenses; and (3) the adoption becomes final. Your MAGI amount for 2023 is less than $239,230. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,950 from your gross income for 2023. However, the expenses allowable for the adoption credit are limited to $10,000 ($15,950 total expenses paid less $5,950 employer reimbursement).

Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $20,950 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $5,000 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $5,000 from your gross income for 2023 and claim a $15,950 adoption credit ($20,950 total expenses paid less $5,000 employer reimbursement).

Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you pay $33,000 of qualified adoption expenses and your employer reimburses you for $15,950 of those expenses. Assuming you meet all other requirements, you can exclude $15,950 from your gross income for 2023. You can also claim a credit of $15,950. Because of the dollar limitation, the remaining $1,100 of expenses ($33,000 total expenses paid, less $15,950 dollar-limited exclusion, less $15,950 dollar-limited credit) can never be used for either the exclusion or the adoption credit.

Timing rules: For what tax year can you claim the credit?

The tax year for which you can claim the credit depends on the following:

When the expenses are paid;

Whether it's a domestic adoption or a foreign adoption; and

When, if ever, the adoption was finalized.

Generally, the credit is allowable whether the adoption is domestic or foreign. However, the timing rules for claiming the credit for qualified adoption expenses differ, depending on the type of adoption.

A domestic adoption is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year following the year of payment (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified).

is the adoption of a U.S. child (an eligible child who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins). Qualified adoption expenses paid before the year the adoption becomes final are allowable as a credit for the tax year (even if the adoption is never finalized and even if an eligible child was never identified). A foreign adoption is the adoption of an eligible child who isn't yet a citizen or resident of the U.S. or its territories before the adoption effort begins. Qualified adoption expenses paid before and during the year are allowable as a credit for the year when it becomes final.

Once an adoption becomes final, and subject to the dollar limitation, qualified adoption expenses paid during or after the year of finality are allowable as a credit for the year of payment, whether the adoption is foreign or domestic.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

Adoption of U.S. children that a state has determined to have special needs

If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you're generally eligible for the maximum amount of credit in the year of finality. Thus, if the adoption of a child whom a state has determined has special needs becomes final in 2023, the maximum credit allowable generally would be $15,950. However, the maximum amount will be reduced by any qualified adoption expenses you claimed for the same child in a prior year or years, and the MAGI limitation may apply.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Generally, ""special needs adoptions"" are the adoptions of children whom the state's child welfare agency considers difficult to place for adoption.

As a result of the timing rules, qualified adoption expenses allowable in the current year may include expenses paid in a former year or years. Example 4 illustrates the difference between the domestic and the foreign timing rules.

Example 4. An adoptive parent pays qualified adoption expenses of $3,000 in 2021, $4,000 in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023. In 2023, the adoption becomes final.

If the adoption in Example 4 is domestic, the $3,000 of expenses paid in 2021 is allowable in 2022 (the year after the year of payment) and may be claimed as a credit on the parent's 2022 tax return. The adoptive parent claims both the $4,000 paid in 2022 and the $5,000 paid in 2023 as a credit on their 2023 tax return. The $4,000 paid in 2022 is allowable in 2023 (the year after the year of payment); the $5,000 paid in 2023 is allowable in 2023 (the year of finalization). Accordingly, nothing is allowable in 2021, $3,000 is allowable in 2022, and $9,000 ($4,000 plus $5,000) is allowable in 2023. The $3,000 allowable in 2022 reduces the 2022 tax liability, with any excess being carried forward into 2023. Similarly, the $9,000 allowable in 2023 (plus any carried-forward amount from 2022) reduces the 2023 tax liability, with any excess credit, from either year, being carried forward into later years. If the adoption in Example 4 is foreign, the adoptive parent may claim all $12,000 in qualified adoption expenses ($3,000 paid in 2021, $4,000 paid in 2022, and $5,000 in 2023) on the adoptive parent's 2023 tax return, because 2023 is the year when the adoption becomes final.

If the adoptive parent pays an additional $2,000 in qualified adoption expenses in 2024, then that $2,000 is allowable in 2024 (subject to the 2024 MAGI and dollar limitations), whether the adoption is domestic or foreign.

If you adopt a child whom a state has determined has special needs, and if your employer has a written qualified adoption assistance program, you may be eligible for the exclusion, even if you or your employer didn't pay any qualified adoption expenses.

A child has special needs for purpose of the adoption expenses if:

The child is a citizen or resident of the United States or its territories when the adoption effort began; A state determines that the child can't or shouldn't be returned to their parents’ home; and The state determines that the child probably won't be adoptable without assistance provided to the adoptive family.

Don't confuse ""children with special needs"" for purposes of the adoption credit with the definitions of ""children with special needs"" for other purposes. Foreign children aren't considered to have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit. Even U.S. children who have disabilities may not have special needs for purposes of the adoption credit.

To determine your filing status, see Publication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information and What is my filing status?

If you filed your return using the married filing separately filing status in the year particular qualified adoption expenses are first allowable, you generally can't claim the credit or exclusion for those particular expenses. You may need to file an amended return to change to a qualifying filing status within the period of limitations. However, see Married Persons Not Filing Jointly in the Instructions for Form 8839PDF, which describes an exception for certain taxpayers living apart from their spouse and meeting other requirements.

"content: Repayment of the credit

General repayment rules for 2008 purchases. If you were allowed the first-time homebuyer credit for a qualifying home purchase made between April 9, 2008, and December 31, 2008, you generally must repay the credit over 15 years. To repay the credit, you must increase your federal income taxes by 6⅔% (or 1/15) of the amount of the credit for each taxable year in the 15-year repayment period. The repayment period begins with the second taxable year following the year of qualifying home purchase. There are exceptions that may require you to accelerate the repayment (discussed later).

Example – You were allowed a $7,500 first-time homebuyer credit for 2008. You must repay the credit. Your 15-year repayment period started with 2010, the second taxable year from 2008. To repay the credit, you must add $500 (which is 6⅔% of $7,500) to your federal income tax for each taxable year in the repayment period.

General repayment rules for post-2008 purchases. For qualifying purchases made after 2008, the repayment requirement of the first-time homebuyer credit is generally waived. There are exceptions that may require you to accelerate the repayment (discussed next)."|"Repayment of the credit

General repayment rules for post-2008 purchases. For qualifying purchases made after 2008, the repayment requirement of the first-time homebuyer credit is generally waived. There are exceptions that may require you to accelerate the repayment (discussed next).

Acceleration of repayment. In general, in the case of a home purchased in 2008 for which you received the first-time homebuyer credit, if you dispose of it, or you (and your spouse if married) stop using it as a principal residence in any taxable year during a 15-year repayment period, the credit repayment is accelerated. Similarly, in the case of a home purchased after 2008 for which you received the credit, if you dispose of it or you (and your spouse if married) stop using it as a principal residence within 36 months from the purchase date, the credit repayment is accelerated.

If you're subject to an accelerated credit repayment, you must increase your federal income tax for the year of disposition or cessation of use by the amount of any excess of the credit allowed over the sum of the additional taxes paid under the credit repayment requirement. However, there are exceptions.

In the case of a sale of the home to an unrelated person, the increase in tax due to accelerated repayment is limited to the amount of gain (if any) from the sale. To determine the gain for this purpose, you must reduce the adjusted basis in the home by the amount of the first-time homebuyer credit that hasn't been repaid.

In the case of an involuntary conversion of the home, the accelerated repayment requirement doesn't apply if you acquire a new principal residence within two years from the date when the disposition or the cessation of use occurs. The general repayment rules apply to the new principal residence as if it were the converted home.

If a person who claimed the credit dies, repayment of the remaining balance of the credit isn't required unless the credit was claimed on a joint return. If the credit was claimed on a joint return, then the surviving spouse is required to continue repaying his or her half of the credit (regardless of whether he or she was the purchaser) if none of the other exceptions apply.

Reporting the repayment. If required to repay the first-time homebuyer credit, you must file a federal income tax return, even if the gross income doesn't exceed the return filing threshold. If you made a qualifying home purchase in 2008 and owned and used the home as a principal residence in all of 2023, you must enter the additional federal income tax on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), Additional TaxesPDF. You don't need to attach Form 5405, Repayment of the First-Time Homebuyer Credit. If you dispose of the home or if you (and your spouse if married) stopped using it as your principal residence in 2023, you must attach a completed Form 5405 for you (and your spouse if married) to Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.

Advance credit payments

If you receive the benefit of advance payments of the premium tax credit to help pay your insurance premiums, it's important that you notify the Marketplace of any changes in the information the Marketplace used to compute the amount of your advance credit payments. You should promptly report any changes in your household income, your family size, and your address, as well as changes to who in your tax family (you, your spouse, if married filing jointly, and your dependents) is eligible to enroll in health insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicare, to the Health Insurance Marketplace when they happen. Reporting changes will help reduce the possibility that you'll have to repay a significant amount of the advance payments of the credit made on your behalf, which may create an unexpected balance due when you file your federal tax return. Promptly reporting a change could also allow you to get the benefit of more advance credit payments to help with the cost of your premiums.

Filing a tax return

You must file a tax return to claim the premium tax credit. Also, for any year in which you received the benefit of advance credit payments, you must file a federal income tax return for that year to reconcile, or compare, the amount of your advance credit payments with the amount of the premium tax credit you're allowed. You (or whoever enrolled you) should have received Form 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, from the Marketplace with information about your coverage and any advance credit payments. You must file Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC)PDF to claim the premium tax credit and reconcile the advance credit payments with the amount of allowed premium tax credit. Attach your Form 8962 and applicable schedules to Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors or Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. If your electronically filed return is rejected for a missing Form 8962, please refer to How to correct an electronically filed return rejected for a missing Form 8962 for information about the rejection and how to correct it.

Enrollment

Each year the Marketplaces offer an open enrollment period to purchase health insurance for coverage in the following year. Under certain circumstances, eligible individuals may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period to enroll in a health plan through the Marketplace. The Department of Health and Human Services administers the requirements for the Marketplaces and the health plans they offer. For more information about your coverage options, financial assistance, and the Marketplace, visit HealthCare.gov or contact your Marketplace.

"Filing a tax return

You must file a tax return to claim the premium tax credit. Also, for any year in which you received the benefit of advance credit payments, you must file a federal income tax return for that year to reconcile, or compare, the amount of your advance credit payments with the amount of the premium tax credit you're allowed. You (or whoever enrolled you) should have received Form 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, from the Marketplace with information about your coverage and any advance credit payments. You must file Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC)PDF to claim the premium tax credit and reconcile the advance credit payments with the amount of allowed premium tax credit.

Enrollment"|"Taxpayers who purchase health insurance through a Health Insurance Marketplace for themselves or others in their tax family (see the Instructions for Form 8962) may be eligible for the premium tax credit. This tax credit helps make purchasing health insurance coverage more affordable for people with low to moderate incomes. The premium tax credit is refundable, so even if you have little or no income tax liability you still may benefit. Eligible taxpayers may choose to have the Health Insurance Marketplace make advance payments of the premium tax credit directly to their health insurance company to help cover the cost of monthly premiums.

Advance credit payments

If you receive the benefit of advance payments of the premium tax credit to help pay your insurance premiums, it's important that you notify the Marketplace of any changes in the information the Marketplace used to compute the amount of your advance credit payments. You should promptly report any changes in your household income, your family size, and your address, as well as changes to who in your tax family (you, your spouse, if married filing jointly, and your dependents) is eligible to enroll in health insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicare, to the Health Insurance Marketplace when they happen. Reporting changes will help reduce the possibility that you'll have to repay a significant amount of the advance payments of the credit made on your behalf, which may create an unexpected balance due when you file your federal tax return. Promptly reporting a change could also allow you to get the benefit of more advance credit payments to help with the cost of your premiums.

Interest continues to accrue until the amount due is paid in full. Payment of the proposed amount within 30 days will stop additional interest, and possibly, additional penalties, from accruing. You may pay the proposed amount or, if you return the Response form without payment, you can wait until the IRS adjusts your account and sends you a bill. Again, if you wait, interest will accrue until the amount is paid in full.

If you apply for an installment agreement or make a payment online, you must still complete, sign and date the Response form (we require both spouses' signatures if you filed married filing jointly) and return it in the enclosed envelope.

If you don't agree with all the proposed the changes, mark the appropriate box on the Response form and send it to us along with a signed statement explaining why you disagree. Include any supporting documentation you would like us to consider. Send the Response form and supporting documentation to the address listed on the notice by the due date.

Additional information is available on this YouTube video, IRS Letter CP2000: Proposed Changes to Your Tax Return. The video tells taxpayers why they received this notice from the IRS and how to respond if they agree – or disagree – with the proposed changes."|"The IRS receives information from third parties, such as employers and financial institutions. Using an automated system, the Automated Underreporter (AUR) function compares the information reported by third parties to the information reported on your return to identify potential discrepancies. When a potential discrepancy is identified, a tax examiner further reviews the return, comparing the information reported to the IRS by employers, banks, businesses, and other payers on information returns (Forms W-2, 1098, 1099, etc.) to the income, credits, and deductions you report on your income tax return. If a discrepancy exists, a Notice CP2000 is issued. The CP2000 isn't a bill, it's a proposal to adjust your income, payments, credits, and/or deductions. The adjustment may result in additional tax owed or a refund of taxes paid.

The first page of the notice provides a summary of proposed changes to your tax, a phone number to call for assistance, and the steps you should take to respond.

The CP2000 provides:

The amounts you reported on your original or processed amended return

The amounts reported to the IRS by the payer

The payer's name, ID number, the type of document issued (W-2, 1098, 1099), and the taxpayer identification number of the person to whom the document was issued

The proposed changes to your income, tax, credits, and/or payments

A Response form, payment voucher, and an envelope.

Review the information on the CP2000 carefully for accuracy. Determine if you agree or disagree with the proposed changes and how you should respond. On the Response form, indicate whether you agree or disagree with all, some, or none of the proposed changes. If you would like to authorize someone other than yourself to contact the IRS concerning the notice, include the information requested in the Authorization section of the Response form.

Responding to the notice:

If you agree with the proposed changes, complete, sign and date the Response form (we require both spouses’ signatures if you filed married filing jointly) and return it in the enclosed envelope. The CP2000 generally includes interest which is calculated from the due date of the return (regardless of extensions) to 30 days from the date on the notice; certain penalties may also apply but may not be shown. Interest continues to accrue until the amount due is paid in full. Payment of the proposed amount within 30 days will stop additional interest, and possibly, additional penalties, from accruing. You may pay the proposed amount or, if you return the Response form without payment, you can wait until the IRS adjusts your account and sends you a bill. Again, if you wait, interest will accrue until the amount is paid in full.

You can choose one of the payment options listed on our Payments page. If making a payment, be sure to use the enclosed payment voucher to ensure proper application of your payment. You can apply by mail for an installment agreement (payment plan) by sending in your signed Response form AND a completed Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request or apply online by using the Online Payment Agreement application. If your request for an installment agreement is approved, you may be charged a user fee. If you apply for an installment agreement or make a payment online, you must still complete, sign and date the Response form (we require both spouses' signatures if you filed married filing jointly) and return it in the enclosed envelope.

If you don't agree with all the proposed the changes, mark the appropriate box on the Response form and send it to us along with a signed statement explaining why you disagree. Include any supporting documentation you would like us to consider. Send the Response form and supporting documentation to the address listed on the notice by the due date. Include your phone number with area code and the best time of day to call. This will allow IRS the ability to contact you directly and may shorten the time it takes to resolve any outstanding issues.

Don't file an amended return (Form 1040-X) for the tax year shown on page one of your notice. Once we receive your response, we'll make the corrections for you. If you notice the same type of error occurring in another tax year, file an amended return for that year to prevent or reduce the accrual of penalties.

Interest compounds daily. Visit Newsroom Search for the current quarterly interest rate on underpayments. In addition, if you file a return but don't pay all tax owed on time, you'll generally have to pay a late payment penalty. The failure-to-pay penalty is one-half of one percent for each month, or part of a month, up to a maximum of 25%, of the amount of tax that remains unpaid from the due date of the return until the tax is paid in full. The one-half of one percent rate increases to one percent if the tax remains unpaid 10 days after the IRS issues a notice of intent to levy property. If you file your return by its due date and request an installment agreement, the one-half of one percent rate decreases to one-quarter of one percent for any month in which an installment agreement is in effect. Be aware that the IRS applies payments to the tax first, then any penalty, then to interest. Any penalty amount that appears on your bill is generally the total amount of the penalty up to the date of the notice, not the penalty amount charged each month. See Topic no. 202 for information about payment options.

See Topic no. 202 for information about payment options. If you owe tax and don't file on time, there's also a penalty for not filing on time. The failure-to-file penalty is usually five percent of the tax owed for each month, or part of a month that your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. If your return is over 60 days late, there's also a minimum penalty for late filing; it's the lesser of $485 (for tax returns required to be filed in 2024) or 100 percent of the tax owed. See Topic no. 304 for information about extensions of time to file if you can't file on time.

You must file your return and pay your tax by the due date to avoid interest and penalty charges. Often, you can borrow the funds necessary to pay your tax at a lower effective rate than the combined IRS interest and penalty rate.

Electronic payment options, available on our Payments page, are the most convenient ways for you to pay your federal taxes. However, if you decide to pay by mail, be sure to return the tear-off stub on your bill and use our return envelope, if provided. To make sure your payment credits properly to your account, please:

Make your check or money order payable to the United States Treasury

Enter the taxpayer identification number (Social Security number, individual taxpayer identification number, or employer identification number) of the primary taxpayer

Enter the tax year and form number

Ensure your name, address, and telephone number are on the payment

Don't send cash

For more information about ensuring proper credit of payments, see Topic no. 158.

The IRS may abate your penalties for filing and paying late if you can show reasonable cause and that the failure wasn't due to willful neglect. Making a good faith payment as soon as you can, may help to establish that your initial failure to pay timely was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. If you're billed for penalty charges and you have reasonable cause for abatement of the penalty, send your explanation along with the bill to your service center, or call us at 800-829-1040 for assistance (see telephone assistance for hours of operation). The IRS doesn't generally abate interest charges and they continue to accrue until all assessed tax, penalties, and interest are fully paid.

There are some exceptions to the general deadlines for filing a return and paying tax, such as:

If you're a member of the Armed Forces and are serving in a combat zone or contingency operation. Refer to Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide for additional information and qualifications.

If you're a citizen or resident alien working abroad. Refer to Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad for details.

If you were a victim in certain disaster situations. In those situations, the IRS has the authority to postpone filing and payment deadlines. Refer to Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses for more information.

It's important that you review your notice or bill. If after reviewing it you believe there's an error, write to the IRS office that sent it to you within the time frame given or call the number listed on your notice or bill for assistance. You should provide photocopies of any records that may help the IRS address the error. If you're correct, we'll make the necessary adjustment to your account and send you a revised notice.

If your return is over 60 days late, there's also a minimum penalty for late filing; it's the lesser of $485 (for tax returns required to be filed in 2024) or 100 percent of the tax owed. See Topic no. 304 for information about extensions of time to file if you can't file on time.

You must file your return and pay your tax by the due date to avoid interest and penalty charges. Often, you can borrow the funds necessary to pay your tax at a lower effective rate than the combined IRS interest and penalty rate.

Electronic payment options, available on our Payments page, are the most convenient ways for you to pay your federal taxes. However, if you decide to pay by mail, be sure to return the tear-off stub on your bill and use our return envelope, if provided. To make sure your payment credits properly to your account, please:

Make your check or money order payable to the United States Treasury

Enter the taxpayer identification number (Social Security number, individual taxpayer identification number, or employer identification number) of the primary taxpayer

Enter the tax year and form number

Ensure your name, address, and telephone number are on the payment

Don't send cash

The IRS may abate your penalties for filing and paying late if you can show reasonable cause and that the failure wasn't due to willful neglect. Making a good faith payment as soon as you can, may help to establish that your initial failure to pay timely was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. If you're billed for penalty charges and you have reasonable cause for abatement of the penalty, send your explanation along with the bill to your service center, or call us at 800-829-1040 for assistance (see telephone assistance for hours of operation). The IRS doesn't generally abate interest charges and they continue to accrue until all assessed tax, penalties, and interest are fully paid.

There are some exceptions to the general deadlines for filing a return and paying tax, such as:

If you're a member of the Armed Forces and are serving in a combat zone or contingency operation. Refer to Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide for additional information and qualifications.

If you're a citizen or resident alien working abroad. Refer to Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad for details.

If you were a victim in certain disaster situations. In those situations, the IRS has the authority to postpone filing and payment deadlines. Refer to Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses for more information.

It's important that you review your notice or bill. If after reviewing it you believe there's an error, write to the IRS office that sent it to you within the time frame given or call the number listed on your notice or bill for assistance. You should provide photocopies of any records that may help the IRS address the error. If you're correct, we'll make the necessary adjustment to your account and send you a revised notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

If you have additional items listed

Your notice may have more items listed, such as Schedule C income, the premium tax credit or child and dependent care tax credit. First, let's cover other important information you need to know.

If we don't hear from you

If you think you qualify for one or more of the items shown on your Notice CP75 or CP75A, please send us all requested information by the date in this section of the Notice. If you need more time to get all the documents ready, call us at the number listed on the top right part of the page. If you do not respond by the date in this section, we will complete our audit and send you an examination report and our proposed changes to your tax return.

But, if you review your tax return and your notice and realize you didn't qualify for any of the items shown on your notice, don't send anything. We'll get back to you with an examination report after the deadline shown on your notice.

Response form

The last part of the notice is the response form. If you have documents proving you may claim one or more of the items listed, you need to complete the response form and either:

Upload the completed response form to us along with copies of the records, documents, and statements using your computer or mobile device at IRS.gov/examreply or by scanning the QR code on your notice.

After we receive your information

It takes at least 30 days to review the documents you send us. You don't need to do anything until you hear from us.

If you sent us copies of documents that proved you were eligible for items you claimed on your tax return, we will send you a notice to let you know your audit is closed. If we held your refund, you should get your refund in eight weeks if you don't owe other taxes or debts we're required to collect.

If the documents you send don't give us the information we need or only verify some of the items, we will send you an audit report. The report will explain our proposed changes and show the amount of tax you owe or the corrected amount of any refund you may receive.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

Dependents"|"You received this notice because the IRS is auditing your tax return. We're asking for information to verify items you claimed on your tax return. You must send in the documents needed to close your audit or we will send you an audit report showing our proposed changes.

Please don't ignore this notice. It's very important that we hear from you by the date shown on your notice. If you need more time to get all the requested information, please call the number on your notice to let us know. Also, it's important that we be able to contact you during the audit. If you move or change your phone number, please let us know by calling the toll-free number on the notice, faxing or uploading the response section of your notice. The fax number is shown on your notice. You can upload your response using your computer or mobile device at IRS.gov/examreply or you can scan the quick response (QR) code found on your notice.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

If you have additional items listed"|"You received this notice because the IRS is auditing your tax return. We're asking for information to verify items you claimed on your tax return. You must send in the documents needed to close your audit or we will send you an audit report showing our proposed changes.

Please don't ignore this notice. It's very important that we hear from you by the date shown on your notice. If you need more time to get all the requested information, please call the number on your notice to let us know. Also, it's important that we be able to contact you during the audit. If you move or change your phone number, please let us know by calling the toll-free number on the notice, faxing or uploading the response section of your notice. The fax number is shown on your notice. You can upload your response using your computer or mobile device at IRS.gov/examreply or you can scan the quick response (QR) code found on your notice.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We're asking for information to verify items you claimed on your tax return. You must send in the documents needed to close your audit or we will send you an audit report showing our proposed changes.

Please don't ignore this notice. It's very important that we hear from you by the date shown on your notice. If you need more time to get all the requested information, please call the number on your notice to let us know. Also, it's important that we be able to contact you during the audit. If you move or change your phone number, please let us know by calling the toll-free number on the notice, faxing or uploading the response section of your notice. The fax number is shown on your notice. You can upload your response using your computer or mobile device at IRS.gov/examreply or you can scan the quick response (QR) code found on your notice.

This notice tells you what items on your tax return the IRS is auditing. We've also included other forms or publications that have important information about what you must send us and what you need to know about your rights during an audit and more. We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

We'll walk you through each step of what to do and when to refer to the other documents. It's helpful to have a copy of your tax return when you're going through this notice.

Before we begin, here are some important tips:

At the top of the notice on the right side, we list the tax year that we're auditing. When we use the term tax year, we mean that year.

Any documents you send in need to cover the year we're auditing.

Don't send original documents. Send us copies.

Earned income credit (EIC)

The first item listed is the earned income credit (EIC). Enclosed in the packet with your Notice CP75 or CP75A is a Form 886-H-EICPDF that lists all the different documents you can send to prove you may claim the EIC with one or more qualifying children. You can send any combination of these documents to provide the information we need. Look at the Schedule EIC you filed with your tax return and complete the following steps for each qualifying child listed:

First, you must prove you lived with your child in the U.S. for more than half the tax year: If your child lived with you at the address shown on your notice, you need to send a document showing your child lived at that same address for more than half the tax year. For example: you could send copies of school records for your child that have your name and show the child's address. The dates on the document must be for more than half the tax year (for school records you may need more than one semester to show more than half the year). If you moved and you and your child lived at another address, you must send documents showing the same address for both of you for more than half the tax year. If your child didn't go to school, you can send in copies of medical records or a statement from a daycare provider. If you need to get a statement from your child's school, or daycare or medical care provider, you can find templates here. Your school or provider can copy and paste the template to their letterhead to make sure all the required information is provided. Don't forget to check the Form 886-H-EIC PDF for more examples of documents you can send. If you can't prove your child lived with you for more than half the tax year, you cannot get the EIC.

Second, you must verify how you're related to the child. The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Your son, daughter, adopted child, stepchild, foster child or a descendent of any of them, such as your grandchild Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother, step sister or a descendant of any of them, such as a niece or a nephew



The Form 886-H-EIC PDF gives examples of what to send to prove how you're related.



The child must be related to you in one of these ways: Third, if your child is age 19 years old or over, you must verify either that: Your child was under age 24 at the end of the tax year, and a full-time student for at least five months of the tax year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) (you can do this by sending copies of official school records), or Your child is permanently and totally disabled (you can do this by sending a copy of one of the official documents shown on Form 886-H-EIC PDF ).

Fourth, you must verify you, your spouse (if filing a joint return) and your child have a valid SSN for employment: To claim the EIC, you (and your spouse, if filing a joint return) must have a valid SSN issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions). Any qualifying child listed on Schedule EIC also must have a valid SSN by the due date of your return for the tax year we are auditing (including extensions).



You can claim the EIC only if your child lived with you for more than half the tax year in the United States. Your child must also be related to you in one of the ways listed on the Form 886-H-EICPDF, and be an eligible age. Your child must meet all three of these requirements to qualify you for the EIC. If you can't show that your child meets all the requirements, you may still be eligible for the EIC without a qualifying child.

Taxpayers who have valid SSNs for employment can claim the credit, even if their children don't have SSNs. In this instance, they may be eligible for the EITC credit available to childless workers.

Married but separated spouses can choose to be treated as not married for EITC purposes. To be treated as not married for EITC purposes, a married taxpayer cannot file jointly with the spouse, cannot have the same principal residence as the spouse on the last day of the year if legally separated under a written agreement or decree of separate maintenance, or for the last six months of the year if not legally separated, and must have a qualifying child living with the taxpayer for more than half the year. Refer to Form 14824, Supporting Documents to Prove Filing StatusPDF and Schedule EIC for additional information.

Dependents

The next item is the dependents you claimed. Your dependents are listed in the middle of the first page of your tax return. The Form 886-H-DEPPDF lists all the documents or combination of documents you can use to prove you can claim each child listed as your dependent. To claim a child as a dependent qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the tax year (the residency test), be related to you (the relationship test), be a certain age (the age test), and have not provided over half of his or her own support (the support test).

If each child listed on your Schedule EIC is the same child you claimed as a dependent, you can use the same documents you used to prove you may claim the EIC to prove the child met the tests for a dependent qualifying child. You don't have to send in copies of the same documents or look for different ones. But, you must use the Form 886-H-DEP PDF to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test.

to see what information must be provided to verify that the child meets the support test. Support test To meet the support test, the child can't pay more than half of his or her own support. You don't need to send proof of support at this time.



If you received this CP75 notice, you claimed a child as a dependent qualifying child. If you find the child doesn't meet the rules to be your qualifying child, you may be able to claim the child as a dependent qualifying relative. See the rules on the Form 886-H-DEPPDF for a qualifying relative. If the child meets the rules, you need to send the documents listed on the Form 886-H-DEP for a qualifying relative.

Filing status

The next item listed is filing status. Look at the first page of your tax return, the first line shows your filing status.

Look at the Form 14824PDF that lists all the different documents or combination of documents you can send to prove that the filing status you used allows you to claim the EITC.

To file as head of household, you must pass three tests: the marriage test, the qualifying person test, and the cost of keeping up a home test.

First, you must meet the marriage test: If you were never married or you're a widow or widower, don't submit anything for the marriage test. Only submit documents for the qualifying person and cost of keeping up a home test. If you're still married and lived with your spouse at any time during the last six months of the year, you can't file as head of household, unless your spouse was a nonresident alien at any time during the tax year. Instead, you must file either as married filing jointly or married filing separately. If you were divorced or legally separated by December 31 of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send a copy of your divorce decree or separation papers. If you're still married but lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year shown on your notice, you must send us documents, such as a copy of a lease agreement, showing you and your spouse lived at different addresses.

Next is the qualifying person test: The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test.

The documents you send for the EIC and to prove you had a qualifying dependent will show you meet this test. So, you don't have to send us any more documents for this test. Third is the cost of keeping up a home test: If you didn't meet both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you can't file as head of household. If you met both the marriage and the qualifying person tests, you must send documents showing you paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home that the qualifying person and you lived in for more than half the tax year. You must send us documents showing you paid more than half the household expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, repairs and maintenance. If the qualifying person was your parent, you did not have to live with your parent, but you must prove that you paid more than half of the cost of maintaining a home for your parent for the entire tax year.



American opportunity credit

The next section is the American opportunity credit (AOTC). If you claimed AOTC, you filed Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)PDF with your tax return. Look for one or two entries on your tax return for the lines listing ""Education credits"" or ""American opportunity credit."" If your tax return shows you didn't claim the credit, you don't need to send documents to prove this credit.

If you claimed AOTC, the student claimed on your Form 8863 may have received a Form 1098-T, Tuition StatementPDF. Schools are required to send this form to all eligible students unless an exception applies. If the student didn't receive this form and is eligible for AOTC, contact the school for the form. Otherwise, you will need to show the student was enrolled in an eligible educational institution and the payments for the student’s qualified tuition and related expenses.

If you received payments for education expenses from your employer, Veterans' Educational Assistance, or other benefits, you can't claim these expenses for this tax credit. You must subtract these expenses paid from your total tuition costs and other eligible expenses.

If you claimed AOTC, we need proof that each student listed on the Form 8863 is eligible. The Form 1098-T has the amount of qualified education expenses paid in box 1. We need a copy of that form.

If you had more expenses than the amount listed in box 1 of the Form 1098-T or you did not receive a Form 1098-T, we need canceled checks or receipts for fees, books, and supplies that were required for the course or courses.

Refer to Form 886-H-AOC, Supporting Documents to Prove American Opportunity CreditPDF for the documents to prove that you are eligible to claim the American Opportunity Credit.

This allowance is taken after any allowable Section 179 deduction and before any other depreciation is allowed.

There are also special rules and limits for depreciation of listed property, including automobiles. Computers and related peripheral equipment are not included as listed property. For more information, refer to Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

Depreciable or not depreciable

The kinds of property that you can depreciate include machinery, equipment, buildings, vehicles, and furniture. You can't claim depreciation on property held for personal purposes. If you use property, such as a car, for both business or investment and personal purposes, you can depreciate only the business or investment use portion. Land is never depreciable, although buildings and certain land improvements may be.

You may depreciate property that meets all the following requirements:

It must be property you own. It must be used in a business or income-producing activity. It must have a determinable useful life. It must be expected to last more than one year. It must not be excepted property.

You must furnish Copies B, C, and 2 of Form W-2 to your employees by January 31, 2024. You'll meet the furnish requirement if the form is properly addressed and mailed on or before the due date. If an employee stops working for you before the end of the year, you may give your former employee Form W-2 any time prior to, but no later than January 31, 2024. If your employee asks for the Form W-2, you must give your employee Copies B, C, and 2 within 30 days of the request or within 30 days of the final wage payment, whichever is later.

Electronic filing requirement

Employers filing 10 or more information returns, including Forms W-2, must file electronically unless granted a waiver by the IRS. All employers are encouraged to file Forms W-2 electronically. For more information on electronic filing, refer to the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 and Topic no. 801, Topic no. 802 and Topic no. 803. You may obtain additional information on electronic filing of Forms W-2 and W-3 from the SSA's Business Services Online (BSO) or by calling 800-772-6270 (TTY 800-325-0778).

Filing by mail

The official Form W-2 is available as a multi-copy form packet. The form packet provides all six copies that the user may need for each Form W-2 (Copy A, Copy 1, Copy B, Copy C, Copy 2, and Copy D). The address for mailing Copy A of the Form(s) W-2 and Form W-3 is also listed in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3PDF. The Form W-3 and Copy A of each Form W-2 that you send to the SSA must be on official red-ink versions (or approved substitute versions) and can be ordered online or by calling 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Refer to the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for additional information.

Make a copy of Form W-3 and a copy of each Form W-2 (Copy A or Copy D) to keep for your records for at least 4 years.

Send Copy 1, if applicable, to your state, city, or local tax department. Contact that state, city, or local tax department for requirements and transmittal information.

Preparing Form W-2

Type all entries using black ink and, if possible, in a 12-point Courier font. Entries are read by machine. Handwritten, script, or italicized fonts are discouraged. Entries made in other than black ink can't be read.

Make all dollar entries without the dollar sign and comma but with the decimal point (00000.00). Show the cents portion of the money amounts; use zeros for no cents.

Don't make any erasures, cross-outs, or whiteouts. Copy A must be error-free. If you make an error, put an ""X"" in the ""VOID"" box, use the next Form W-2, and start again. Don't write ""corrected"" on the next Form W-2.

Because Form W-2 is printed with two forms on a single page, send in the whole Copy A page (the page printed with red ink) to the SSA even if one form is blank or void. Don't cut or fold the page. Don't staple Forms W-2 to each other or to Form W-3.

If a box doesn't apply, leave it blank.

Making corrections

If you discover an error on an employee's Form W-2 after sending it to the SSA, submit a Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.

"content: General information

When you hire an employee, you must have the employee complete a Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate. Form W-4 tells you the employee's filing status, multiple jobs adjustments, amount of credits, amount of other income, amount of deductions, and any additional amount to withhold from each paycheck to use to compute the amount of federal income tax to deduct and withhold from the employee's pay. If an employee fails to give you a properly completed Form W-4, you must withhold federal income taxes from his or her wages as if he or she were single or married filing separately with no other entries on step 2, 3, or 4 of the Form W-4. This means that a single filer's standard deduction with no other entries will be considered in determining withholding.

An employee may want to change the entries on Form W-4 for any number of reasons when his or her personal or financial situation changes. If you receive a revised Form W-4 from an employee, you must put it into effect no later than the start of the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from the date you received the revised Form W-4. You must honor the request unless the situations described below in the sections Invalid Form W-4 and Lock-in letters apply."|"General information

You must honor the request unless the situations described below in the sections Invalid Form W-4 and Lock-in letters apply.

You can download and print a Form W-4, order multiple copies, or call 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). You may also use a substitute Form W-4 you developed instead of the official Form W-4, if you also provide the tables, instructions, and worksheets contained in the Form W-4 in effect at that time. The substitute Form W-4 must contain language that's identical to the official Form W-4 and must meet current IRS rules for substitute forms. You may not accept a substitute form developed by an employee. The employee submitting such form will be treated as failing to furnish a Form W-4.

Form W-4 includes detailed worksheets to help the employee figure his or her correct adjustments. Employees may also want to access the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator for help in completing Form W-4. Nonresident aliens must follow special instructions when completing a Form W-4. Have your nonresident alien employees see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens and the Instructions for Form 8233, Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual before completing a Form W-4. They should also review Chapter 8 of Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for important information on withholding.

You may establish an electronic system to receive Forms W-4 from your employees. Refer to Employment Tax Regulations section 31.3402(f)(5)-1(c) and Publication 15-A, Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide for more information.

You can access other language versions of Form W-4 from the About Form W-4 page.

You should inform your employees of the importance of submitting an accurate Form W-4. An employee may be subject to a $500 penalty if he or she submits, with no reasonable basis, a Form W-4 that results in less tax being withheld than is required. Refer to Chapter 4 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax For Individuals.

For additional information, refer to Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods and Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. For the procedures for withholding income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees, refer to Publication 15-T.

Exemption from withholding

If an employee qualifies, he or she can also use Form W-4 to tell you not to deduct any federal income tax from his or her wages. To qualify for this exempt status, the employee must have had no tax liability for the previous year and must expect to have no tax liability for the current year. A Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding is valid for only the calendar year in which it's furnished to the employer. To continue to be exempt from withholding in the next year, an employee must give you a new Form W-4 claiming exempt status by February 15 of that year. This date is delayed until the next business day if it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. If the employee doesn't give you a new Form W-4 by February 15, withhold tax as if he or she is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. If the employee provides a new Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding on February 16 or later, you may apply it to future wages but don’t refund any taxes withheld while the exempt status wasn’t in place.

Invalid Form W-4

Any unauthorized change or addition to Form W-4 makes it invalid. This includes taking out any language by which the employee certifies that the form is correct, material defacing of the form, or any writing on the form other than the entries requested. A Form W-4 is also invalid if by the date an employee gives it to you, he or she indicates in any way that it's false. When you get an invalid Form W-4, don't use it to determine federal income tax withholding. Tell the employee that it's invalid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give you a valid one, withhold taxes as if the employee is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. However, if you have an earlier Form W-4 for this employee that's valid, withhold as you did before.

Recordkeeping requirements

After the employee completes and signs the Form W-4, you must keep it in your records for at least 4 years (see Publication 15 and Topic no. 305, Recordkeeping). This form serves as verification that you're withholding federal income tax according to the employee's instructions and needs to be available for inspection should the IRS ever request it. Form W-4 is still subject to review. You may be directed (in a written notice or in future published guidance) to send certain Forms W-4 to the IRS. You must be able to supply a hardcopy of an electronic Form W-4.

Lock-in letters

The IRS uses information reported on Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement to identify employees with withholding compliance problems. In some cases, where a serious under-withholding problem is found to exist for a particular employee, the IRS may issue a notice (commonly referred to as a ""lock-in-letter"") to you specifying the filing status, multiple job adjustments, and maximum amount of credit or deductions permitted for a specific employee for purposes of calculating the required withholding (see Publication 15). The IRS will provide the employee with an opportunity to dispute the determination before you adjust withholding based on the lock-in letter.

The IRS will send a letter to the employee explaining that the IRS will require you to start withholding additional income tax unless the employee contacts the IRS to explain why the employee shouldn't have withholding increased. A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program will be provided in the letter. As an additional safeguard, you'll also receive a notice to provide to the employee.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, you must disregard any Form W-4 that results in less tax withheld, until the IRS notifies you otherwise. However, you MUST honor any Form W-4 that results in more income tax withheld than at the withholding arrangement specified in the lock-in letter. Employers who use electronic Form W-4 systems must make sure the employee can't override the lock-in letter to decrease withholding via an electronic Form W-4 system. Lock-in letter provisions also apply to employees rehired within 12 months from the date of the notice.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, if the employee wants to claim complete exemption from withholding or claim a filing status, multiple job adjustments, or an amount of credits or deductions that results in less income tax withheld than the lock-in letter, the employee must contact the IRS. A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program is provided in the lock-in letter."|105|employer tax information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc753|d9bf6d3a08c14a0da7f072018348cad1

Have your nonresident alien employees see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens and the Instructions for Form 8233, Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual before completing a Form W-4. They should also review Chapter 8 of Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for important information on withholding.

You may establish an electronic system to receive Forms W-4 from your employees. Refer to Employment Tax Regulations section 31.3402(f)(5)-1(c) and Publication 15-A, Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide for more information.

You can access other language versions of Form W-4 from the About Form W-4 page.

You should inform your employees of the importance of submitting an accurate Form W-4. An employee may be subject to a $500 penalty if he or she submits, with no reasonable basis, a Form W-4 that results in less tax being withheld than is required. Refer to Chapter 4 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax For Individuals.

For additional information, refer to Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods and Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. For the procedures for withholding income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees, refer to Publication 15-T.

Exemption from withholding

If an employee qualifies, he or she can also use Form W-4 to tell you not to deduct any federal income tax from his or her wages. To qualify for this exempt status, the employee must have had no tax liability for the previous year and must expect to have no tax liability for the current year. A Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding is valid for only the calendar year in which it's furnished to the employer. To continue to be exempt from withholding in the next year, an employee must give you a new Form W-4 claiming exempt status by February 15 of that year. This date is delayed until the next business day if it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. If the employee doesn't give you a new Form W-4 by February 15, withhold tax as if he or she is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. If the employee provides a new Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding on February 16 or later, you may apply it to future wages but don’t refund any taxes withheld while the exempt status wasn’t in place.

Invalid Form W-4

Any unauthorized change or addition to Form W-4 makes it invalid. This includes taking out any language by which the employee certifies that the form is correct, material defacing of the form, or any writing on the form other than the entries requested. A Form W-4 is also invalid if by the date an employee gives it to you, he or she indicates in any way that it's false. When you get an invalid Form W-4, don't use it to determine federal income tax withholding. Tell the employee that it's invalid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give you a valid one, withhold taxes as if the employee is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. However, if you have an earlier Form W-4 for this employee that's valid, withhold as you did before.

Recordkeeping requirements

After the employee completes and signs the Form W-4, you must keep it in your records for at least 4 years (see Publication 15 and Topic no. 305, Recordkeeping). This form serves as verification that you're withholding federal income tax according to the employee's instructions and needs to be available for inspection should the IRS ever request it. Form W-4 is still subject to review. You may be directed (in a written notice or in future published guidance) to send certain Forms W-4 to the IRS. You must be able to supply a hardcopy of an electronic Form W-4.

Lock-in letters

The IRS uses information reported on Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement to identify employees with withholding compliance problems. In some cases, where a serious under-withholding problem is found to exist for a particular employee, the IRS may issue a notice (commonly referred to as a ""lock-in-letter"") to you specifying the filing status, multiple job adjustments, and maximum amount of credit or deductions permitted for a specific employee for purposes of calculating the required withholding (see Publication 15). The IRS will provide the employee with an opportunity to dispute the determination before you adjust withholding based on the lock-in letter.

The IRS will send a letter to the employee explaining that the IRS will require you to start withholding additional income tax unless the employee contacts the IRS to explain why the employee shouldn't have withholding increased. A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program will be provided in the letter. As an additional safeguard, you'll also receive a notice to provide to the employee.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, you must disregard any Form W-4 that results in less tax withheld, until the IRS notifies you otherwise. However, you MUST honor any Form W-4 that results in more income tax withheld than at the withholding arrangement specified in the lock-in letter. Employers who use electronic Form W-4 systems must make sure the employee can't override the lock-in letter to decrease withholding via an electronic Form W-4 system. Lock-in letter provisions also apply to employees rehired within 12 months from the date of the notice.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, if the employee wants to claim complete exemption from withholding or claim a filing status, multiple job adjustments, or an amount of credits or deductions that results in less income tax withheld than the lock-in letter, the employee must contact the IRS. A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program is provided in the lock-in letter."|105|employer tax information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc753|682589c60e5c444190a755bc07a1f3b9

Exemption from withholding"|"General information

When you hire an employee, you must have the employee complete a Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate. Form W-4 tells you the employee's filing status, multiple jobs adjustments, amount of credits, amount of other income, amount of deductions, and any additional amount to withhold from each paycheck to use to compute the amount of federal income tax to deduct and withhold from the employee's pay. If an employee fails to give you a properly completed Form W-4, you must withhold federal income taxes from his or her wages as if he or she were single or married filing separately with no other entries on step 2, 3, or 4 of the Form W-4. This means that a single filer's standard deduction with no other entries will be considered in determining withholding.

An employee may want to change the entries on Form W-4 for any number of reasons when his or her personal or financial situation changes. If you receive a revised Form W-4 from an employee, you must put it into effect no later than the start of the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from the date you received the revised Form W-4. You must honor the request unless the situations described below in the sections Invalid Form W-4 and Lock-in letters apply.

You can download and print a Form W-4, order multiple copies, or call 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676).

In some cases, where a serious under-withholding problem is found to exist for a particular employee, the IRS may issue a notice (commonly referred to as a ""lock-in-letter"") to you specifying the filing status, multiple job adjustments, and maximum amount of credit or deductions permitted for a specific employee for purposes of calculating the required withholding (see Publication 15). The IRS will provide the employee with an opportunity to dispute the determination before you adjust withholding based on the lock-in letter.

The IRS will send a letter to the employee explaining that the IRS will require you to start withholding additional income tax unless the employee contacts the IRS to explain why the employee shouldn't have withholding increased. A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program will be provided in the letter. As an additional safeguard, you'll also receive a notice to provide to the employee."|"General information

When you hire an employee, you must have the employee complete a Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate. Form W-4 tells you the employee's filing status, multiple jobs adjustments, amount of credits, amount of other income, amount of deductions, and any additional amount to withhold from each paycheck to use to compute the amount of federal income tax to deduct and withhold from the employee's pay. If an employee fails to give you a properly completed Form W-4, you must withhold federal income taxes from his or her wages as if he or she were single or married filing separately with no other entries on step 2, 3, or 4 of the Form W-4. This means that a single filer's standard deduction with no other entries will be considered in determining withholding.

An employee may want to change the entries on Form W-4 for any number of reasons when his or her personal or financial situation changes. If you receive a revised Form W-4 from an employee, you must put it into effect no later than the start of the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from the date you received the revised Form W-4. You must honor the request unless the situations described below in the sections Invalid Form W-4 and Lock-in letters apply.

You can download and print a Form W-4, order multiple copies, or call 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). You may also use a substitute Form W-4 you developed instead of the official Form W-4, if you also provide the tables, instructions, and worksheets contained in the Form W-4 in effect at that time. The substitute Form W-4 must contain language that's identical to the official Form W-4 and must meet current IRS rules for substitute forms. You may not accept a substitute form developed by an employee. The employee submitting such form will be treated as failing to furnish a Form W-4.

Form W-4 includes detailed worksheets to help the employee figure his or her correct adjustments. Employees may also want to access the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator for help in completing Form W-4. Nonresident aliens must follow special instructions when completing a Form W-4. Have your nonresident alien employees see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens and the Instructions for Form 8233, Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual before completing a Form W-4. They should also review Chapter 8 of Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for important information on withholding.

You may establish an electronic system to receive Forms W-4 from your employees. Refer to Employment Tax Regulations section 31.3402(f)(5)-1(c) and Publication 15-A, Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide for more information.

You can access other language versions of Form W-4 from the About Form W-4 page.

You should inform your employees of the importance of submitting an accurate Form W-4. An employee may be subject to a $500 penalty if he or she submits, with no reasonable basis, a Form W-4 that results in less tax being withheld than is required. Refer to Chapter 4 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax For Individuals.

For additional information, refer to Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods and Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. For the procedures for withholding income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees, refer to Publication 15-T.

Exemption from withholding

If an employee qualifies, he or she can also use Form W-4 to tell you not to deduct any federal income tax from his or her wages. To qualify for this exempt status, the employee must have had no tax liability for the previous year and must expect to have no tax liability for the current year. A Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding is valid for only the calendar year in which it's furnished to the employer. To continue to be exempt from withholding in the next year, an employee must give you a new Form W-4 claiming exempt status by February 15 of that year. This date is delayed until the next business day if it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. If the employee doesn't give you a new Form W-4 by February 15, withhold tax as if he or she is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. If the employee provides a new Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding on February 16 or later, you may apply it to future wages but don’t refund any taxes withheld while the exempt status wasn’t in place.

Invalid Form W-4

Any unauthorized change or addition to Form W-4 makes it invalid. This includes taking out any language by which the employee certifies that the form is correct, material defacing of the form, or any writing on the form other than the entries requested. A Form W-4 is also invalid if by the date an employee gives it to you, he or she indicates in any way that it's false. When you get an invalid Form W-4, don't use it to determine federal income tax withholding. Tell the employee that it's invalid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give you a valid one, withhold taxes as if the employee is single or married filing separately with no other entries in step 2, 3, or 4. However, if you have an earlier Form W-4 for this employee that's valid, withhold as you did before.

Recordkeeping requirements

After the employee completes and signs the Form W-4, you must keep it in your records for at least 4 years (see Publication 15 and Topic no. 305, Recordkeeping). This form serves as verification that you're withholding federal income tax according to the employee's instructions and needs to be available for inspection should the IRS ever request it. Form W-4 is still subject to review. You may be directed (in a written notice or in future published guidance) to send certain Forms W-4 to the IRS. You must be able to supply a hardcopy of an electronic Form W-4.

Lock-in letters

The IRS uses information reported on Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement to identify employees with withholding compliance problems. In some cases, where a serious under-withholding problem is found to exist for a particular employee, the IRS may issue a notice (commonly referred to as a ""lock-in-letter"") to you specifying the filing status, multiple job adjustments, and maximum amount of credit or deductions permitted for a specific employee for purposes of calculating the required withholding (see Publication 15).

A toll-free number and address for the unit handling this program will be provided in the letter. As an additional safeguard, you'll also receive a notice to provide to the employee.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, you must disregard any Form W-4 that results in less tax withheld, until the IRS notifies you otherwise. However, you MUST honor any Form W-4 that results in more income tax withheld than at the withholding arrangement specified in the lock-in letter. Employers who use electronic Form W-4 systems must make sure the employee can't override the lock-in letter to decrease withholding via an electronic Form W-4 system. Lock-in letter provisions also apply to employees rehired within 12 months from the date of the notice.

After the lock-in letter takes effect, if the employee wants to claim complete exemption from withholding or claim a filing status, multiple job adjustments, or an amount of credits or deductions that results in less income tax withheld than the lock-in letter, the employee must contact the IRS.

"content: An employer identification number (EIN) is a nine-digit number assigned by the IRS. It's used to identify the tax accounts of employers and certain others who have no employees.

Household workers are your employees if you can control not only the work they do, but also how they do it.

Social Security and Medicare taxes (Federal Insurance Contributions Act – FICA)

If you paid cash wages to household employees totaling more than $1,000 in any calendar quarter during the calendar year or the prior year, you generally must pay federal unemployment tax (FUTA) tax on the first $7,000 of cash wages you pay to each household employee. However, don't count wages paid to your spouse, your child who is under the age of 21, or your parent. Also, don't consider cash wages that you pay to a household employee in excess of $7,000 as wages subject to FUTA tax. Don’t withhold the FUTA tax from your employee’s wages. You must pay it from your own funds. The FUTA tax is 6% of your employee’s FUTA wages.

Also, don't consider cash wages that you pay to a household employee in excess of $7,000 as wages subject to FUTA tax. Don’t withhold the FUTA tax from your employee’s wages. You must pay it from your own funds. The FUTA tax is 6% of your employee’s FUTA wages. You may be able to take a credit of up to 5.4% against your FUTA tax liability for amounts you paid into state unemployment funds, resulting in a net tax rate of 0.6%. For more information, refer to ""Do You Need To Pay Employment Taxes?"" in Publication 926. If you paid wages that are subject to the unemployment compensation laws of a credit reduction state, your FUTA tax credit may be reduced. A state that hasn't repaid money it borrowed from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits is a ""credit reduction state."" See the Instructions for Schedule H (Form 1040) or FUTA Credit Reduction for more information.

Schedule H (Form 1040), Household Employment Taxes

If you pay wages subject to FICA tax, FUTA tax, or if you withhold federal income tax from your employee's wages, you'll need to file a Schedule H (Form 1040), Household Employment Taxes. Attach Schedule H to your individual income tax return, Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, Form 1040-NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, Form 1040-SS, U.S. Self-Employment Tax Return (Including the Additional Child Tax Credit for Bona Fide Residents of Puerto Rico), or Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts. If you're not required to file a return, file Schedule H by itself to report household employment taxes. However, a sole proprietor who must file Form 940, Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return, and Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, or Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, for business employees, or Form 943, Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees, for farm employees, may report household employee tax information on these forms instead of on Schedule H. If you choose to report the wages for a household employee on the forms shown above, be sure to pay any taxes due by the date required based on the form, making federal tax deposits if required. Additional information is available in the Instructions for Schedule H (Form 1040)PDF.

Estimated tax payments

If you file Schedule H (Form 1040)PDF, you can avoid owing taxes with your return if you pay enough tax before you file your return to cover both the employment taxes for your household employee and your income tax. If you're employed, you can ask your employer to withhold more federal income tax from your wages during the year. You can also make estimated tax payments to the IRS during the year using Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals.

Social Security and Medicare taxes (Federal Insurance Contributions Act – FICA)

Social Security tax and Medicare tax, commonly referred to as FICA tax, applies to both employees and employers, each paying 7.65% of wages. An employer is generally required to withhold the household employee's share of FICA tax from wages. If you pay cash wages of $2,700 or more for 2024 (this threshold can change from year to year) to any one household employee, you generally must withhold 6.2% for Social Security tax and 1.45% for Medicare tax (for a total of 7.65%) from all cash wages you pay to that employee, unless you prefer to pay your employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes from your own funds. You must also pay your share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, which is also 7.65% of cash wages. Cash wages include wages you pay by check, money order, etc.

You can find the specified dollar amounts and percentages under the topic ""Social Security and Medicare Taxes"" in Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide. Pay the amount you withhold to the IRS with an additional 7.65% for your share of the taxes. If you pay your employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes from your own funds, the amounts you pay for your employee count as wages for purposes of the employees' income tax. However, don't count them as Social Security and Medicare wages or as wages for federal unemployment tax.

Don't withhold or pay Social Security and Medicare taxes from wages you pay to:

Your spouse, Your child under the age of 21, Your parent, unless an exception is met, or An employee who is under age 18 at any time during the year, unless performing household work is the employee's principal occupation. If the employee is a student, providing household work isn't considered to be his or her principal occupation.

See Publication 926PDF for more information on these exceptions.

Additional Medicare tax

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status.

An employer is required to begin withholding additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

Rather, the terms identify which set of deposit rules you must follow when an employment tax liability arises. The deposit rules are based on the dates when wages are paid (cash basis), not on when tax liabilities are accrued for accounting purposes. For the rules on filing requirements, refer to Topic no. 758.

Liability under $2,500: If you're required to file Form 941 and your employment tax liability for the preceding quarter or current quarter is less than $2,500, you may pay the taxes for the current quarter with your timely filed return instead of making deposits, provided you don't incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter.

Similarly, if you're required to file Form 944 and your employment tax liability for the year is less than $2,500, you may pay the taxes for the year with your timely filed return instead of making deposits. If you're required to file Form 944 and your employment tax liability for the fourth quarter is less than $2,500, you may pay your fourth quarter liability with your timely filed return, as long as you've made deposits for the first, second, and third quarters according to the applicable deposit rules. Employers below the $2,500 threshold who aren't required to make deposits may choose to deposit the taxes or pay the amount shown as due on the Form 941 or Form 944 when they file that form, as provided by the form instructions.

Liability of $2,500 or more: Unless you're eligible to make payments with your return, you must deposit your taxes. If you're a Form 941 filer and you're not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500, and your liability for the preceding quarter wasn't less than $2,500, make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won't be subject to failure-to-deposit penalties.

When to deposit

You must make deposits according to one of two deposit schedules—monthly or semiweekly. The schedule you use for the current calendar year depends on the amount of employment taxes you reported during your lookback period. If you've filed only Form 941, the lookback period is the 12 months (covering four quarters) starting July 1st of the second preceding year and ending on June 30th of the prior year. If you filed Form 944 in either of the two previous years or you're filing Form 944 in the current year, the lookback period is the calendar year two years prior to the year for which you’re depositing (see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, Section 11, Depositing Taxes).

Monthly schedule depositor - If you reported taxes of $50,000 or less during the lookback period, you're a monthly schedule depositor, and you generally must deposit your employment taxes on payments made during a given month on or before the 15th day of the following month. For example, you must deposit taxes on payments made in January by February 15. If the 15th of any calendar month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia, the deposit is due by the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia.

Semiweekly schedule depositor - If you reported taxes of more than $50,000 for the lookback period, you're a semiweekly schedule depositor, and you generally must deposit your employment taxes based on the following schedule:

If your payday is on Wednesday, Thursday, and/or Friday, you must deposit these taxes by the following Wednesday. If your payday is on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and/or Tuesday, you must deposit these taxes by the following Friday.

If you're required to make a deposit on a day that's not a business day, the deposit is considered timely if you make it by the close of the next business day. For example, if you're required to make a deposit on a Friday and that Friday is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, the deposit will be considered timely if you make it by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day). A statewide holiday that is not a legal holiday in the District of Columbia doesn't delay the due date of federal tax deposits. Semiweekly schedule depositors have at least 3 business days following the close of the semiweekly period to make a deposit. If any of the 3 weekdays after the end of a semiweekly period is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, you'll have an additional day for each of those days to make the required deposit.

$100,000 next-day deposit rule - Regardless of whether you're a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor, if you accumulate taxes of $100,000 or more on any day during a deposit period, you must deposit the taxes by the next business day after you accumulate the $100,000. If this happens, you become a semiweekly depositor for at least the remainder of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. For details on the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule, see Section 11 of Publication 15.

New employer - If you're a new employer, your taxes in the lookback period are considered to be zero for any quarter before you started or acquired your business. Therefore, in the first year of business, you're a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 next-day deposit rule applies.

How to deposit

You must make all federal tax deposits using electronic funds transfer (EFT), generally by using EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of Treasury. For your EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must schedule the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due. Visit EFTPS.gov or call 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD) to enroll. You may also find additional information in Publication 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, A Guide to Getting StartedPDF. If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Services provided by a third party may have a fee and a different cutoff time.

If you fail to initiate a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) for a same-day payment. If you anticipate that you'll ever need to use the same-day payment method, be sure to arrange this ahead of time with your financial institution. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way.

You're required to deposit 100% of your tax liability on or before the deposit due date. Penalties may apply for depositing late, depositing less than the required amount, or for mailing payments directly to the IRS instead of depositing the amounts. The IRS may waive penalties in certain cases. See Publication 15 for more information on accuracy of deposit rules and penalties."|108|employer tax information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc757|459e5d01b4c14062996de43f4f5d5164

"$100,000 next-day deposit rule - Regardless of whether you're a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor, if you accumulate taxes of $100,000 or more on any day during a deposit period, you must deposit the taxes by the next business day after you accumulate the $100,000. If this happens, you become a semiweekly depositor for at least the remainder of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. For details on the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule, see Section 11 of Publication 15.

New employer - If you're a new employer, your taxes in the lookback period are considered to be zero for any quarter before you started or acquired your business. Therefore, in the first year of business, you're a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 next-day deposit rule applies.

How to deposit"|"As an employer, you're generally required to deposit the employment taxes reported on Forms 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return. Both forms report federal income tax withheld from your employees, along with the employer's and employees' shares of Social Security and Medicare tax. The amount of employment taxes you previously reported on your Forms 941 or 944 determines which deposit schedule you must use—monthly or semiweekly. The terms ""monthly schedule depositor"" and ""semiweekly schedule depositor"" don't refer to how often your business pays its employees or even how often you’re required to make deposits. Rather, the terms identify which set of deposit rules you must follow when an employment tax liability arises. The deposit rules are based on the dates when wages are paid (cash basis), not on when tax liabilities are accrued for accounting purposes. For the rules on filing requirements, refer to Topic no. 758.

Liability under $2,500: If you're required to file Form 941 and your employment tax liability for the preceding quarter or current quarter is less than $2,500, you may pay the taxes for the current quarter with your timely filed return instead of making deposits, provided you don't incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation during the current quarter.

Similarly, if you're required to file Form 944 and your employment tax liability for the year is less than $2,500, you may pay the taxes for the year with your timely filed return instead of making deposits. If you're required to file Form 944 and your employment tax liability for the fourth quarter is less than $2,500, you may pay your fourth quarter liability with your timely filed return, as long as you've made deposits for the first, second, and third quarters according to the applicable deposit rules. Employers below the $2,500 threshold who aren't required to make deposits may choose to deposit the taxes or pay the amount shown as due on the Form 941 or Form 944 when they file that form, as provided by the form instructions.

Liability of $2,500 or more: Unless you're eligible to make payments with your return, you must deposit your taxes. If you're a Form 941 filer and you're not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500, and your liability for the preceding quarter wasn't less than $2,500, make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won't be subject to failure-to-deposit penalties.

When to deposit

You must make deposits according to one of two deposit schedules—monthly or semiweekly. The schedule you use for the current calendar year depends on the amount of employment taxes you reported during your lookback period. If you've filed only Form 941, the lookback period is the 12 months (covering four quarters) starting July 1st of the second preceding year and ending on June 30th of the prior year. If you filed Form 944 in either of the two previous years or you're filing Form 944 in the current year, the lookback period is the calendar year two years prior to the year for which you’re depositing (see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, Section 11, Depositing Taxes).

Monthly schedule depositor - If you reported taxes of $50,000 or less during the lookback period, you're a monthly schedule depositor, and you generally must deposit your employment taxes on payments made during a given month on or before the 15th day of the following month. For example, you must deposit taxes on payments made in January by February 15. If the 15th of any calendar month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia, the deposit is due by the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia.

Semiweekly schedule depositor - If you reported taxes of more than $50,000 for the lookback period, you're a semiweekly schedule depositor, and you generally must deposit your employment taxes based on the following schedule:

If your payday is on Wednesday, Thursday, and/or Friday, you must deposit these taxes by the following Wednesday. If your payday is on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and/or Tuesday, you must deposit these taxes by the following Friday.

If you're required to make a deposit on a day that's not a business day, the deposit is considered timely if you make it by the close of the next business day. For example, if you're required to make a deposit on a Friday and that Friday is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, the deposit will be considered timely if you make it by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day). A statewide holiday that is not a legal holiday in the District of Columbia doesn't delay the due date of federal tax deposits. Semiweekly schedule depositors have at least 3 business days following the close of the semiweekly period to make a deposit. If any of the 3 weekdays after the end of a semiweekly period is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, you'll have an additional day for each of those days to make the required deposit.

$100,000 next-day deposit rule - Regardless of whether you're a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor, if you accumulate taxes of $100,000 or more on any day during a deposit period, you must deposit the taxes by the next business day after you accumulate the $100,000. If this happens, you become a semiweekly depositor for at least the remainder of the calendar year and for the following calendar year. For details on the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule, see Section 11 of Publication 15.

New employer - If you're a new employer, your taxes in the lookback period are considered to be zero for any quarter before you started or acquired your business. Therefore, in the first year of business, you're a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 next-day deposit rule applies.

How to deposit

You must make all federal tax deposits using electronic funds transfer (EFT), generally by using EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of Treasury. For your EFTPS deposit to be on time, you must schedule the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due. Visit EFTPS.gov or call 800-555-4477 or 800-733-4829 (TDD) to enroll. You may also find additional information in Publication 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, A Guide to Getting StartedPDF. If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. Services provided by a third party may have a fee and a different cutoff time.

If you fail to initiate a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) for a same-day payment. If you anticipate that you'll ever need to use the same-day payment method, be sure to arrange this ahead of time with your financial institution.

"content: Generally, you must file Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return to report wages you've paid and tips your employees have reported to you, as well as employment taxes (federal income tax withheld, Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld, and your share of Social Security and Medicare taxes).

Form 941 is generally due by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. For example, you're required to file Form 941 by April 30 for wages you pay during the first quarter, January through March. If you've deposited all of your taxes on time, you have ten additional days after the due date of the return to file.

If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide (Section 11, Depositing Taxes – Deposits Due on Business Days Only).

Form 944

Some employers with small payrolls, including government employers, may file an annual return, Form 944 instead of Form 941 each quarter, if you are eligible and properly so indicated on your Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number. Form 944 is designed for employers with an annual employment tax liability of $1,000 or less. Form 944 generally is due on January 31 of the following year. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10. As with Form 941, if the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The purpose of Form 944 is to reduce burden on small employers by allowing them to file one return per year and in most cases pay the employment tax with the return.

Employers may be eligible to file Form 944 if their estimated annual employment tax liability is $1,000 or less. If an employer's employment tax liability is expected to be $1,000 or less and the employer wants to file Form 944 and did not indicate this on the Form SS-4, the employer must contact the IRS to request to file Form 944. Employers aren't permitted to file Form 944 unless they are notified by the IRS to do so. Employers required to file Form 944, who want to file Forms 941 instead, must notify the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941 and receive approval to do so. See the Instructions for Form 944 for more information.

Employers notified to file Form 944, whose businesses grow during the year and whose employment tax liability exceeds the $1,000 threshold, must still file Form 944 for the year. Employers who exceed the eligibility threshold must not file Form 941 until the IRS notifies them that their filing requirement has been changed to Form 941. For information on requesting to file Forms 941 quarterly or Form 944 annually to report your social security, Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes, refer to the Instructions for Form 944PDF and the Instructions for Form 941PDF.

Depositing and reporting taxes

Generally, employers are required to deposit their employment taxes rather than pay the taxes when the Form 941 or Form 944 is filed. For the rules for making deposits, refer to Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes) and Topic no. 757.

Adjustments and corrections - In certain cases, you must adjust amounts reported as Social Security and Medicare taxes to arrive at your correct tax liability. Forms 941 and 944 contain lines which allow you to enter adjustments to tax due to:

Fractions of cents that you gained or lost by rounding when you computed payroll for each individual employee.

Sick pay for which Social Security and Medicare taxes were withheld by a third party that is not your agent, such as an insurance company.

Uncollected employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips and/or group-term life insurance premiums paid for former employees.

If you wish to correct an error on a previously filed Form 941 or Form 944, use Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund or Form 944-X, Adjusted Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, respectively.

Calculating and reporting the taxes - You become liable for employment taxes when you pay the employees their wages, not when the pay period ends. For example, if you file Form 941 and your pay period ends September 24 but you don't pay the employees until October 1, their wages would be reported in the fourth quarter when you actually paid the employees their wages and became liable for the tax, not the third quarter when the pay period ended.

The federal income tax withheld and Social Security and Medicare taxes are added together on either Form 941 or Form 944. The resulting net tax after credits and adjustments is the amount of employment taxes you owe for the quarter (Form 941) or the year (Form 944). If this amount is $2,500 or more, and you're a monthly schedule depositor, for either Form 941 or Form 944 complete the tax liability for each month in Part 2. If you file Form 941 and are a semiweekly depositor, then report your tax liability by date on Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule DepositorsPDF. If you file Form 944 and are a semiweekly depositor, then report your tax liability by date on Form 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability. The IRS uses this information to determine if you deposited your employment taxes for each deposit period on time.

Penalties - It's very important that monthly schedule depositors complete Part 2 (Form 941 or Form 944) and semiweekly schedule depositors complete Schedule B (Form 941) or Form 945-A (Form 944) correctly, or it may appear that you didn't deposit your taxes when due. There's a late deposit penalty ranging from 2% to 15%, depending on the length of time the deposit is late.

Generally, unless you're eligible to pay taxes with your return, you should have deposited your taxes and shouldn't have a balance due with Form 941 or Form 944. If you pay taxes with your tax return that should have been deposited, you may be subject to a penalty. See Topic no. 757 and Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes) for rules on depositing taxes and making a payment of tax with your return. Be sure to sign and date Form 941 or Form 944 before mailing.

Form 941

You're required to file a separate Form 941 for each quarter (first quarter - January through March, second quarter - April through June, third quarter - July through September, fourth quarter - October through December). Form 941 is generally due by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. For example, you're required to file Form 941 by April 30 for wages you pay during the first quarter, January through March. If you've deposited all of your taxes on time, you have ten additional days after the due date of the return to file.

If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day.

If an employer's employment tax liability is expected to be $1,000 or less and the employer wants to file Form 944 and did not indicate this on the Form SS-4, the employer must contact the IRS to request to file Form 944. Employers aren't permitted to file Form 944 unless they are notified by the IRS to do so. Employers required to file Form 944, who want to file Forms 941 instead, must notify the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941 and receive approval to do so. See the Instructions for Form 944 for more information.

Employers notified to file Form 944, whose businesses grow during the year and whose employment tax liability exceeds the $1,000 threshold, must still file Form 944 for the year. Employers who exceed the eligibility threshold must not file Form 941 until the IRS notifies them that their filing requirement has been changed to Form 941.

If you've deposited all of your taxes on time, you have ten additional days after the due date of the return to file.

If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide (Section 11, Depositing Taxes – Deposits Due on Business Days Only).

Form 944

Some employers with small payrolls, including government employers, may file an annual return, Form 944 instead of Form 941 each quarter, if you are eligible and properly so indicated on your Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number. Form 944 is designed for employers with an annual employment tax liability of $1,000 or less. Form 944 generally is due on January 31 of the following year. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10. As with Form 941, if the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The purpose of Form 944 is to reduce burden on small employers by allowing them to file one return per year and in most cases pay the employment tax with the return.

Employers may be eligible to file Form 944 if their estimated annual employment tax liability is $1,000 or less. If an employer's employment tax liability is expected to be $1,000 or less and the employer wants to file Form 944 and did not indicate this on the Form SS-4, the employer must contact the IRS to request to file Form 944. Employers aren't permitted to file Form 944 unless they are notified by the IRS to do so. Employers required to file Form 944, who want to file Forms 941 instead, must notify the IRS to request to file quarterly Forms 941 and receive approval to do so. See the Instructions for Form 944 for more information.

Employers notified to file Form 944, whose businesses grow during the year and whose employment tax liability exceeds the $1,000 threshold, must still file Form 944 for the year. Employers who exceed the eligibility threshold must not file Form 941 until the IRS notifies them that their filing requirement has been changed to Form 941. For information on requesting to file Forms 941 quarterly or Form 944 annually to report your social security, Medicare, and withheld federal income taxes, refer to the Instructions for Form 944PDF and the Instructions for Form 941PDF.

Depositing and reporting taxes

Generally, employers are required to deposit their employment taxes rather than pay the taxes when the Form 941 or Form 944 is filed. For the rules for making deposits, refer to Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes) and Topic no. 757.

Adjustments and corrections - In certain cases, you must adjust amounts reported as Social Security and Medicare taxes to arrive at your correct tax liability. Forms 941 and 944 contain lines which allow you to enter adjustments to tax due to:

Fractions of cents that you gained or lost by rounding when you computed payroll for each individual employee.

Sick pay for which Social Security and Medicare taxes were withheld by a third party that is not your agent, such as an insurance company.

Uncollected employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips and/or group-term life insurance premiums paid for former employees.

If you wish to correct an error on a previously filed Form 941 or Form 944, use Form 941-X, Adjusted Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund or Form 944-X, Adjusted Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return or Claim for Refund, respectively.

Calculating and reporting the taxes - You become liable for employment taxes when you pay the employees their wages, not when the pay period ends. For example, if you file Form 941 and your pay period ends September 24 but you don't pay the employees until October 1, their wages would be reported in the fourth quarter when you actually paid the employees their wages and became liable for the tax, not the third quarter when the pay period ended.

The federal income tax withheld and Social Security and Medicare taxes are added together on either Form 941 or Form 944. The resulting net tax after credits and adjustments is the amount of employment taxes you owe for the quarter (Form 941) or the year (Form 944). If this amount is $2,500 or more, and you're a monthly schedule depositor, for either Form 941 or Form 944 complete the tax liability for each month in Part 2. If you file Form 941 and are a semiweekly depositor, then report your tax liability by date on Schedule B (Form 941), Report of Tax Liability for Semiweekly Schedule DepositorsPDF. If you file Form 944 and are a semiweekly depositor, then report your tax liability by date on Form 945-A, Annual Record of Federal Tax Liability. The IRS uses this information to determine if you deposited your employment taxes for each deposit period on time.

Penalties - It's very important that monthly schedule depositors complete Part 2 (Form 941 or Form 944) and semiweekly schedule depositors complete Schedule B (Form 941) or Form 945-A (Form 944) correctly, or it may appear that you didn't deposit your taxes when due. There's a late deposit penalty ranging from 2% to 15%, depending on the length of time the deposit is late.

Generally, unless you're eligible to pay taxes with your return, you should have deposited your taxes and shouldn't have a balance due with Form 941 or Form 944. If you pay taxes with your tax return that should have been deposited, you may be subject to a penalty. See Topic no. 757 and Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes) for rules on depositing taxes and making a payment of tax with your return. Be sure to sign and date Form 941 or Form 944 before mailing.

Form 941

You're required to file a separate Form 941 for each quarter (first quarter - January through March, second quarter - April through June, third quarter - July through September, fourth quarter - October through December).

"content: Who must file Form 940?

Most employers pay both a federal (FUTA) and a state unemployment tax. There are three tests used to determine whether you must pay FUTA tax: a general test, a household employees test and an agricultural employees (farmworkers) test.

Under the general test, you're subject to FUTA tax on the wages you pay employees who aren't household or agricultural employees and must file Form 940, Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return for 2023 if:

You paid wages of $1,500 or more to employees in any calendar quarter during 2022 or 2023, or

You had one or more employees for at least some part of a day in any 20 or more different weeks in 2022 or 20 or more different weeks in 2023. Count all full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. If your business is a partnership, don't count its partners.

If a business was sold or transferred during the year, each employer who meets one of the above conditions must file Form 940. However, don't include any wages paid by the predecessor employer on your Form 940 unless you're a successor employer. For details, see ""Successor employer"" in the Instructions for Form 940. If you won't be liable for filing Form 940 in the future, see ""Final: Business closed or stopped paying wages"" in the Instructions for Form 940PDF."|"Who must file Form 940?

If you won't be liable for filing Form 940 in the future, see ""Final: Business closed or stopped paying wages"" in the Instructions for Form 940PDF.

For the household employees test and the agricultural employees (farmworkers) test, see Section 14, Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax in Publication 15 (Circular E), Employers Tax Guide. Additional information for household employers is available in Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide and Topic no. 756. Additional information for agricultural employers is available in Publication 15 and Topic no. 760, Reporting and deposit requirements for agricultural employers.

FUTA tax rate: The FUTA tax rate is 6.0%. The tax applies to the first $7,000 you paid to each employee as wages during the year. The $7,000 is often referred to as the federal or FUTA wage base. Your state wage base may be different based on the applicable state's rules.

Generally, if you paid into state unemployment funds, you may receive a credit of up to 5.4% of FUTA taxable wages when you file your Form 940. If you're entitled to the maximum 5.4% credit, the FUTA tax rate after credit is 0.6%. You're entitled to the maximum credit if you paid your state unemployment taxes in full, by the due date of your Form 940, and on all the same wages as are subject to FUTA tax and the state isn't determined to be a credit reduction state. See the Instructions for Form 940 to determine the credit.

Credit reduction state: This is a state that hasn't repaid money it borrowed from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits. The Department of Labor runs the loan program and determines the credit reduction states each year; see FUTA Credit Reduction for more information. If an employer pays wages that are subject to the unemployment tax laws of a credit reduction state, the credit an employer may receive for state unemployment tax it paid is reduced, resulting in a greater amount of federal unemployment tax due when filing its Form 940 and including the Schedule A (Form 940), Multi-State Employer and Credit Reduction InformationPDF. You must use Schedule A (Form 940) if you paid wages to employees in more than one state or if you paid wages in any state that's subject to credit reduction.

When to file?

The due date for filing the Form 940 is January 31. However, if you deposited all FUTA tax when due, you have until February 10 to file. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes – Deposits Due on Business Days Only).

When and how must you deposit your FUTA tax?

Although Form 940 covers a calendar year, you may have to deposit your FUTA tax before you file your return. If your FUTA tax liability is more than $500 for the calendar year, you must deposit at least one quarterly payment. If your FUTA tax liability is $500 or less in a quarter, carry it forward to the next quarter. Continue carrying your tax liability forward until your cumulative FUTA tax liability is more than $500. At that point, you must deposit your FUTA tax for the quarter. Deposit your FUTA tax by the last day of the month after the end of the quarter. If your FUTA tax liability for the next quarter is $500 or less, you're not required to deposit your tax again until the cumulative amount is more than $500. If your FUTA tax liability for the fourth quarter (plus any undeposited amounts from earlier quarters) is $500 or less, you can either deposit the amount or pay the tax with your Form 940 by January 31. If you're required to make a deposit on a day that's not a business day, the deposit is considered timely if you make it by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For example, if you're required to make a deposit on a Friday and Friday is a legal holiday, the deposit will be considered timely if you make it by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day).

Once your FUTA tax liability for a quarter (including any FUTA tax carried forward from an earlier quarter), is more than $500, you must deposit the tax by electronic funds transfer. In years where there are credit reduction states, you must include liabilities owed for credit reduction with your fourth quarter deposit.

You must use electronic funds transfer (EFT) for all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made by using Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Refer to Publication 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, A Guide to Getting StartedPDF for EFTPS information, and Publication 15 for more information on deposit rules."|110|employer tax information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc759|af042f7f508e41fcb72e56ef84cec0a7

If you won't be liable for filing Form 940 in the future, see ""Final: Business closed or stopped paying wages"" in the Instructions for Form 940PDF.

For the household employees test and the agricultural employees (farmworkers) test, see Section 14, Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax in Publication 15 (Circular E), Employers Tax Guide. Additional information for household employers is available in Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide and Topic no. 756. Additional information for agricultural employers is available in Publication 15 and Topic no. 760, Reporting and deposit requirements for agricultural employers.

FUTA tax rate: The FUTA tax rate is 6.0%. The tax applies to the first $7,000 you paid to each employee as wages during the year. The $7,000 is often referred to as the federal or FUTA wage base. Your state wage base may be different based on the applicable state's rules.

Generally, if you paid into state unemployment funds, you may receive a credit of up to 5.4% of FUTA taxable wages when you file your Form 940. If you're entitled to the maximum 5.4% credit, the FUTA tax rate after credit is 0.6%. You're entitled to the maximum credit if you paid your state unemployment taxes in full, by the due date of your Form 940, and on all the same wages as are subject to FUTA tax and the state isn't determined to be a credit reduction state. See the Instructions for Form 940 to determine the credit.

Credit reduction state: This is a state that hasn't repaid money it borrowed from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits. The Department of Labor runs the loan program and determines the credit reduction states each year; see FUTA Credit Reduction for more information. If an employer pays wages that are subject to the unemployment tax laws of a credit reduction state, the credit an employer may receive for state unemployment tax it paid is reduced, resulting in a greater amount of federal unemployment tax due when filing its Form 940 and including the Schedule A (Form 940), Multi-State Employer and Credit Reduction InformationPDF. You must use Schedule A (Form 940) if you paid wages to employees in more than one state or if you paid wages in any state that's subject to credit reduction.

When to file?

The due date for filing the Form 940 is January 31. However, if you deposited all FUTA tax when due, you have until February 10 to file. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes – Deposits Due on Business Days Only).

When and how must you deposit your FUTA tax?

Although Form 940 covers a calendar year, you may have to deposit your FUTA tax before you file your return. If your FUTA tax liability is more than $500 for the calendar year, you must deposit at least one quarterly payment. If your FUTA tax liability is $500 or less in a quarter, carry it forward to the next quarter. Continue carrying your tax liability forward until your cumulative FUTA tax liability is more than $500. At that point, you must deposit your FUTA tax for the quarter. Deposit your FUTA tax by the last day of the month after the end of the quarter. If your FUTA tax liability for the next quarter is $500 or less, you're not required to deposit your tax again until the cumulative amount is more than $500. If your FUTA tax liability for the fourth quarter (plus any undeposited amounts from earlier quarters) is $500 or less, you can either deposit the amount or pay the tax with your Form 940 by January 31. If you're required to make a deposit on a day that's not a business day, the deposit is considered timely if you make it by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For example, if you're required to make a deposit on a Friday and Friday is a legal holiday, the deposit will be considered timely if you make it by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day).

Once your FUTA tax liability for a quarter (including any FUTA tax carried forward from an earlier quarter), is more than $500, you must deposit the tax by electronic funds transfer. In years where there are credit reduction states, you must include liabilities owed for credit reduction with your fourth quarter deposit.

You must use electronic funds transfer (EFT) for all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made by using Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Refer to Publication 966, Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, A Guide to Getting StartedPDF for EFTPS information, and Publication 15 for more information on deposit rules."|110|employer tax information|https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc759|2c3455b56ab44db896bab53f43d6b008

Most employers pay both a federal (FUTA) and a state unemployment tax. There are three tests used to determine whether you must pay FUTA tax: a general test, a household employees test and an agricultural employees (farmworkers) test.

Under the general test, you're subject to FUTA tax on the wages you pay employees who aren't household or agricultural employees and must file Form 940, Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return for 2023 if:

You paid wages of $1,500 or more to employees in any calendar quarter during 2022 or 2023, or

You had one or more employees for at least some part of a day in any 20 or more different weeks in 2022 or 20 or more different weeks in 2023. Count all full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. If your business is a partnership, don't count its partners.

If a business was sold or transferred during the year, each employer who meets one of the above conditions must file Form 940. However, don't include any wages paid by the predecessor employer on your Form 940 unless you're a successor employer. For details, see ""Successor employer"" in the Instructions for Form 940.

Information for employers of H-2A visa workers

Foreign agricultural workers temporarily admitted to the United States on H-2A visas are exempt from U.S. Social Security and Medicare taxes on payments for services performed under the H-2A visa. Their compensation isn't subject to mandatory income tax withholding unless backup withholding applies.

You may voluntarily withhold U.S. federal income tax from the H-2A worker's wages if both you and the worker agree. In that case, the worker must give the employer a completed Form W-4. The amount of federal income tax withheld is entered on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.

You must also report wages paid to an H-2A worker on a Form W-2 if the worker presents a valid taxpayer identification number and was paid $600 or more during the calendar year. You don't report any Social Security or Medicare wages or Social Security or Medicare taxes in the applicable boxes on the H-2A worker's Form W-2.

Wages may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of 24% if the H-2A worker didn't provide you with a valid taxpayer identification number and the aggregate annual wages you paid to the H-2A worker is at least $600. If backup withholding applies, then you must report the wages subject to backup withholding and the federal income tax withheld from those wages on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Information and Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Tax. If an employer doesn't properly withhold the 24% tax from such payments, the employer may be liable for the amount of tax that should have been withheld.

All cash wages that you pay to farmworkers are subject to federal income tax withholding and Social Security and Medicare taxes for any calendar year in which:

You pay an employee cash wages of $150 or more in a year for agricultural labor (farmwork), or

The total (cash and noncash) wages that you pay to all farmworkers is $2,500 or more.

There are some exceptions for hand-harvest workers you pay less than $150 during the year.

Generally, you must file your Form 943 by January 31 of the year after you paid the wages. If you deposited all Form 943 taxes when due, you may file by February 10. When the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is delayed until the next business day. To e-file your Form 943, see E-file Employment Tax Forms.

If your total employment taxes will exceed $2,500 in the year, you'll have to make electronic deposits throughout the year as a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor.

You'll use your lookback period to determine whether you must pay the tax according to a monthly or a semiweekly deposit schedule. For Form 943, the lookback period is the second calendar year preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period for 2024 is 2022. If, during the lookback period, you reported $50,000 or less of tax on Form 943, you're a monthly schedule depositor. If you had over $50,000 of Form 943 tax, you're a semiweekly schedule depositor.

Additionally, if you accumulate $100,000 of liability in any deposit period, you must deposit the tax by the next business day, whether you're a monthly or semiweekly schedule depositor. If you're a monthly schedule depositor and accumulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day of a calendar month, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year.

Generally, you must use electronic funds transfer (EFT) to make all federal tax deposits. When depositing the taxes, using EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, you'll have to make the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the due date to be considered timely.

Refer to Publication 15 (Section 11, Depositing Taxes) for more information. See also Topic no. 752, Filing Forms W-2 and W-3 and Topic no. 759, Form 940 – Employer's Annual Federal (FUTA) Tax Return – Filing and deposit requirements.

Information for employers of H-2A visa workers

Foreign agricultural workers temporarily admitted to the United States on H-2A visas are exempt from U.S. Social Security and Medicare taxes on payments for services performed under the H-2A visa. Their compensation isn't subject to mandatory income tax withholding unless backup withholding applies.

You may voluntarily withhold U.S. federal income tax from the H-2A worker's wages if both you and the worker agree. In that case, the worker must give the employer a completed Form W-4. The amount of federal income tax withheld is entered on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.

You must also report wages paid to an H-2A worker on a Form W-2 if the worker presents a valid taxpayer identification number and was paid $600 or more during the calendar year. You don't report any Social Security or Medicare wages or Social Security or Medicare taxes in the applicable boxes on the H-2A worker's Form W-2.

Wages may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of 24% if the H-2A worker didn't provide you with a valid taxpayer identification number and the aggregate annual wages you paid to the H-2A worker is at least $600. If backup withholding applies, then you must report the wages subject to backup withholding and the federal income tax withheld from those wages on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Information and Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Tax. If an employer doesn't properly withhold the 24% tax from such payments, the employer may be liable for the amount of tax that should have been withheld.

Recordkeeping

Employees can use Form 4070A, Employee's Daily Record of Tips to keep a daily record of their tips, and Form 4070, Employee's Report of Tips to Employer to report their tips to you. Both forms are available in Publication 1244, Employee's Daily Record of Tips and Report to EmployerPDF. You may also provide other means for your employees to report tips to you, for example, a system for electronic tip reporting by employees.

Withholding taxes

When you receive the tip report from your employee, use it to figure the amount of Social Security, Medicare and income taxes to withhold for the pay period on both wages and reported tips. You're responsible for paying the employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status. Employers are responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax on an individual's wages paid in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year, without regard to filing status. An employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

You collect the employee's portion of these taxes from the wages you pay your employee, or from funds the employee gives you. If you don't have enough money from the employee's wages and funds your employee gives you, withhold taxes in the following order:

All taxes on the employee's wages (exclusive of tips), Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare on the employee's reported tips, and Federal, state, and local income taxes on the employee's reported tips.

Withhold any remaining unpaid federal income taxes from the employee's next paycheck, up to the close of the calendar year. However, if you can't collect all of the employee's Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips by the 10th day of the month following the month in which your employee reported the tips, you don't have to collect these taxes. Show the uncollected amount as an adjustment on your employment tax return (for example, Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return). Also, be sure to report the uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes in the appropriate box on the employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, but don't show any uncollected Additional Medicare tax on Form W-2. You may want to inform your tipped employees that if all the federal income taxes and Additional Medicare tax on their wages and tips won't be collected by the end of the year, they may need to make estimated tax payments. If an employee doesn't pay enough tax throughout the year, either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments, the employees may be subject to a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. Refer your employees to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax for additional information.

When preparing an employee's Form W-2, include wages, tips, and other compensation in the box labeled ""Wages, tips, other compensation."" Include Medicare wages and tips, and Social Security tips in their respective boxes. When figuring the employer's liability for federal unemployment tax, add the reported tips to the employee's wages.

Allocated tips

If you operate a large food or beverage establishment, you must file Form 8027, Employer's Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips for each calendar year and may be required to allocate tips to your employees. You operate a large food or beverage establishment if tipping is customary, you provide food or beverages for consumption on the premises, and you normally employ more than ten people who collectively work more than an average of 80 hours on a typical business day. If you have more than one large food or beverage establishment, you must file a separate Form 8027 for each establishment. Form 8027 is due on the last day of February of the next year (March 31 if filing electronically). If you meet the criteria for filing Form 8027 but don't file, the law provides for penalties for each failure to timely file a correct information return, including failure to file electronically, if required.

If the total tips reported by all employees at your large food or beverage establishment are less than 8 percent of your gross receipts (or a lower rate approved by the IRS), you must allocate the difference between the actual tip income reported and 8 percent of gross receipts among the employees who received tips. You may base the allocation on each employee's share of gross receipts or share of total hours worked, or on a written agreement between you and your employees. You're required to report the amount allocated on Form W-2 in the box labeled ""Allocated Tips"" for each employee to whom you allocated tips. Penalties may be imposed for both failing to file and failing to furnish a correct Form W-2 on which you fail to include this required information. Don't withhold income, Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare, or railroad retirement taxes on allocated tips, since your employee didn't report these amounts to you.

Whether or not you're required to allocate tips, your employees must continue to report all tips to you, and you must use the amounts they report to figure payroll taxes.

Tip Rate Determination and Education Program

The Tip Rate Determination and Education Program (TRD/EP) was designed by the IRS to enhance tax compliance through educational programs and the use of voluntary tip reporting agreements instead of traditional audit techniques. Tip reporting programs improve tip income reporting by helping taxpayers to understand and meet their tip reporting responsibilities and offer many benefits for the employer and the employee. The Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (SITCA) program has recently been proposed to replace two of TRD/EP’s existing tip reporting programs, the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) and the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). SITCA would be available to employers in all service industries except the gaming industry employers. The Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (GITCA) program is available to employers in the gaming (casino) industry. For more information about GITCA, TRDA, or TRAC programs, search for Market Segment Understandings (MSU) by using keyword ""MSU"" on IRS.gov and Publication 3144, Tips on Tips (A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employers in Businesses Where Tip Income is Customary)PDF.

Show the uncollected amount as an adjustment on your employment tax return (for example, Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return). Also, be sure to report the uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes in the appropriate box on the employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, but don't show any uncollected Additional Medicare tax on Form W-2. You may want to inform your tipped employees that if all the federal income taxes and Additional Medicare tax on their wages and tips won't be collected by the end of the year, they may need to make estimated tax payments. If an employee doesn't pay enough tax throughout the year, either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments, the employees may be subject to a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. Refer your employees to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax for additional information.

When preparing an employee's Form W-2, include wages, tips, and other compensation in the box labeled ""Wages, tips, other compensation."" Include Medicare wages and tips, and Social Security tips in their respective boxes. When figuring the employer's liability for federal unemployment tax, add the reported tips to the employee's wages.

Allocated tips

If you operate a large food or beverage establishment, you must file Form 8027, Employer's Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips for each calendar year and may be required to allocate tips to your employees. You operate a large food or beverage establishment if tipping is customary, you provide food or beverages for consumption on the premises, and you normally employ more than ten people who collectively work more than an average of 80 hours on a typical business day. If you have more than one large food or beverage establishment, you must file a separate Form 8027 for each establishment. Form 8027 is due on the last day of February of the next year (March 31 if filing electronically). If you meet the criteria for filing Form 8027 but don't file, the law provides for penalties for each failure to timely file a correct information return, including failure to file electronically, if required.

If the total tips reported by all employees at your large food or beverage establishment are less than 8 percent of your gross receipts (or a lower rate approved by the IRS), you must allocate the difference between the actual tip income reported and 8 percent of gross receipts among the employees who received tips. You may base the allocation on each employee's share of gross receipts or share of total hours worked, or on a written agreement between you and your employees. You're required to report the amount allocated on Form W-2 in the box labeled ""Allocated Tips"" for each employee to whom you allocated tips. Penalties may be imposed for both failing to file and failing to furnish a correct Form W-2 on which you fail to include this required information. Don't withhold income, Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare, or railroad retirement taxes on allocated tips, since your employee didn't report these amounts to you.

Whether or not you're required to allocate tips, your employees must continue to report all tips to you, and you must use the amounts they report to figure payroll taxes.

Tip Rate Determination and Education Program

The Tip Rate Determination and Education Program (TRD/EP) was designed by the IRS to enhance tax compliance through educational programs and the use of voluntary tip reporting agreements instead of traditional audit techniques. Tip reporting programs improve tip income reporting by helping taxpayers to understand and meet their tip reporting responsibilities and offer many benefits for the employer and the employee. The Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (SITCA) program has recently been proposed to replace two of TRD/EP’s existing tip reporting programs, the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) and the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). SITCA would be available to employers in all service industries except the gaming industry employers. The Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (GITCA) program is available to employers in the gaming (casino) industry. For more information about GITCA, TRDA, or TRAC programs, search for Market Segment Understandings (MSU) by using keyword ""MSU"" on IRS.gov and Publication 3144, Tips on Tips (A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employers in Businesses Where Tip Income is Customary)PDF.

Refer your employees to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax for additional information.|"Employees who receive cash tips of $20 or more in a calendar month while working for you, are required to report to you the total amount of tips they receive. The employees must give you written reports by the tenth day of the following month. Employees who receive tips of less than $20 in a calendar month aren't required to report their tips to you but must report these amounts as income on their tax returns and pay taxes, if any.

Cash tips include tips received directly from customers, tips from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement, and charged tips (for example, credit and debit card charges) that you distribute to the employee. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips received to their employer.

Service charges added to a bill or fixed by the employer that the customer must pay, when paid to an employee, won't constitute a tip but rather constitute non-tip wages. These non-tip wages are subject to Social Security tax, Medicare tax and federal income tax withholding. In addition, the employer can't use these non-tip wages when computing the credit available to employers under section 45B of the Internal Revenue Code, because these amounts aren't tips. Common examples of service charges (sometimes called auto-gratuities) in service industries are:

Large party charge (restaurant),

Bottle service charge (restaurant and night-club),

Room service charge (hotel and resort),

Contracted luggage assistance charge (hotel and resort), and

Mandated delivery charge (pizza or other retail deliveries).

Recordkeeping

Employees can use Form 4070A, Employee's Daily Record of Tips to keep a daily record of their tips, and Form 4070, Employee's Report of Tips to Employer to report their tips to you. Both forms are available in Publication 1244, Employee's Daily Record of Tips and Report to EmployerPDF. You may also provide other means for your employees to report tips to you, for example, a system for electronic tip reporting by employees.

Withholding taxes

When you receive the tip report from your employee, use it to figure the amount of Social Security, Medicare and income taxes to withhold for the pay period on both wages and reported tips. You're responsible for paying the employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status. Employers are responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax on an individual's wages paid in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year, without regard to filing status. An employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

You collect the employee's portion of these taxes from the wages you pay your employee, or from funds the employee gives you. If you don't have enough money from the employee's wages and funds your employee gives you, withhold taxes in the following order:

All taxes on the employee's wages (exclusive of tips), Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare on the employee's reported tips, and Federal, state, and local income taxes on the employee's reported tips.

Withhold any remaining unpaid federal income taxes from the employee's next paycheck, up to the close of the calendar year. However, if you can't collect all of the employee's Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips by the 10th day of the month following the month in which your employee reported the tips, you don't have to collect these taxes.

The Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (SITCA) program has recently been proposed to replace two of TRD/EP’s existing tip reporting programs, the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) and the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). SITCA would be available to employers in all service industries except the gaming industry employers. The Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (GITCA) program is available to employers in the gaming (casino) industry. For more information about GITCA, TRDA, or TRAC programs, search for Market Segment Understandings (MSU) by using keyword ""MSU"" on IRS.gov and Publication 3144, Tips on Tips (A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employers in Businesses Where Tip Income is Customary)PDF.

Additional information"|"Employees who receive cash tips of $20 or more in a calendar month while working for you, are required to report to you the total amount of tips they receive. The employees must give you written reports by the tenth day of the following month. Employees who receive tips of less than $20 in a calendar month aren't required to report their tips to you but must report these amounts as income on their tax returns and pay taxes, if any.

Cash tips include tips received directly from customers, tips from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement, and charged tips (for example, credit and debit card charges) that you distribute to the employee. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips received to their employer.

Service charges added to a bill or fixed by the employer that the customer must pay, when paid to an employee, won't constitute a tip but rather constitute non-tip wages. These non-tip wages are subject to Social Security tax, Medicare tax and federal income tax withholding. In addition, the employer can't use these non-tip wages when computing the credit available to employers under section 45B of the Internal Revenue Code, because these amounts aren't tips. Common examples of service charges (sometimes called auto-gratuities) in service industries are:

Large party charge (restaurant),

Bottle service charge (restaurant and night-club),

Room service charge (hotel and resort),

Contracted luggage assistance charge (hotel and resort), and

Mandated delivery charge (pizza or other retail deliveries).

Recordkeeping

Employees can use Form 4070A, Employee's Daily Record of Tips to keep a daily record of their tips, and Form 4070, Employee's Report of Tips to Employer to report their tips to you. Both forms are available in Publication 1244, Employee's Daily Record of Tips and Report to EmployerPDF. You may also provide other means for your employees to report tips to you, for example, a system for electronic tip reporting by employees.

Withholding taxes

When you receive the tip report from your employee, use it to figure the amount of Social Security, Medicare and income taxes to withhold for the pay period on both wages and reported tips. You're responsible for paying the employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status. Employers are responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax on an individual's wages paid in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year, without regard to filing status. An employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

You collect the employee's portion of these taxes from the wages you pay your employee, or from funds the employee gives you. If you don't have enough money from the employee's wages and funds your employee gives you, withhold taxes in the following order:

All taxes on the employee's wages (exclusive of tips), Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare on the employee's reported tips, and Federal, state, and local income taxes on the employee's reported tips.

Withhold any remaining unpaid federal income taxes from the employee's next paycheck, up to the close of the calendar year. However, if you can't collect all of the employee's Social Security and Medicare taxes on tips by the 10th day of the month following the month in which your employee reported the tips, you don't have to collect these taxes. Show the uncollected amount as an adjustment on your employment tax return (for example, Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return). Also, be sure to report the uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes in the appropriate box on the employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, but don't show any uncollected Additional Medicare tax on Form W-2. You may want to inform your tipped employees that if all the federal income taxes and Additional Medicare tax on their wages and tips won't be collected by the end of the year, they may need to make estimated tax payments. If an employee doesn't pay enough tax throughout the year, either through withholding or by making estimated tax payments, the employees may be subject to a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. Refer your employees to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax for additional information.

When preparing an employee's Form W-2, include wages, tips, and other compensation in the box labeled ""Wages, tips, other compensation."" Include Medicare wages and tips, and Social Security tips in their respective boxes. When figuring the employer's liability for federal unemployment tax, add the reported tips to the employee's wages.

Allocated tips

If you operate a large food or beverage establishment, you must file Form 8027, Employer's Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips for each calendar year and may be required to allocate tips to your employees. You operate a large food or beverage establishment if tipping is customary, you provide food or beverages for consumption on the premises, and you normally employ more than ten people who collectively work more than an average of 80 hours on a typical business day. If you have more than one large food or beverage establishment, you must file a separate Form 8027 for each establishment. Form 8027 is due on the last day of February of the next year (March 31 if filing electronically). If you meet the criteria for filing Form 8027 but don't file, the law provides for penalties for each failure to timely file a correct information return, including failure to file electronically, if required.

If the total tips reported by all employees at your large food or beverage establishment are less than 8 percent of your gross receipts (or a lower rate approved by the IRS), you must allocate the difference between the actual tip income reported and 8 percent of gross receipts among the employees who received tips. You may base the allocation on each employee's share of gross receipts or share of total hours worked, or on a written agreement between you and your employees. You're required to report the amount allocated on Form W-2 in the box labeled ""Allocated Tips"" for each employee to whom you allocated tips. Penalties may be imposed for both failing to file and failing to furnish a correct Form W-2 on which you fail to include this required information. Don't withhold income, Social Security, Medicare, Additional Medicare, or railroad retirement taxes on allocated tips, since your employee didn't report these amounts to you.

Whether or not you're required to allocate tips, your employees must continue to report all tips to you, and you must use the amounts they report to figure payroll taxes.

"content: The Affordable Care Act contains comprehensive health insurance reforms and includes tax provisions that affect individuals, families, businesses, insurers, tax-exempt organizations and government entities. These tax provisions contain important changes, including how individuals and families file their taxes. The law also contains benefits and responsibilities for other organizations and employers. The information under the following headings briefly explains some of the current income tax provisions of the legislation.

Small business health care tax credit

This small business health care tax credit helps small employers, including small tax-exempt employers, to afford the cost of covering health insurance premiums for their employees. It specifically targets employers with low and moderate-income workers. The maximum credit is up to 50% of contributions paid by small business employers for premiums, and up to 35% for small tax-exempt employers. In general, the credit is available to small employers that pay at least half the cost of single coverage for their employees. To qualify for the credit, a small employer must pay premiums on behalf of each employee enrolled in a qualified health plan offered by the employer through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace or qualify for an exception to this requirement."|"The Affordable Care Act contains comprehensive health insurance reforms and includes tax provisions that affect individuals, families, businesses, insurers, tax-exempt organizations and government entities.

Health coverage for older children

Health coverage for an employee's children under 27 years of age is generally tax free to the employee. This health care tax benefit applies to various workplace and retiree health plans. As a result, employers with cafeteria plans – plans that allow employees to choose from a menu of tax-free benefit options and cash or taxable benefits – are allowed to permit employees to begin making pre-tax contributions to pay for this expanded benefit. Tax-free treatment for employer-provided health care to an employee's child has been extended until the end of the year in which the child turns age 26. The costs and reimbursements under employer health plans for coverage for an employee's eligible children are free of income, FICA and FUTA taxes, without regard to the IRS's dependency tests. This tax benefit also applies to self-employed individuals who qualify for the self-employed health insurance deduction on their federal income tax return.

Reporting of employer provided health coverage on Form W-2

The Affordable Care Act requires employers to report the cost of coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan on an employee's Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement in Box 12 using Code DD. Reporting the cost of health care coverage on the Form W-2 is for informational purposes only. The purpose for this reporting requirement is to provide employees useful and comparable consumer information on the cost of their health care coverage. The value of the employer's contribution to health coverage continues to be excludable from the employee's income and isn't taxable. Many employers are eligible for transition relief until future guidance limits the availability of some or all of this transition relief for this reporting requirement. The employer isn't required to report the total of the aggregate reportable costs attributable to all the employees on Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. More information about the reporting is available in the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3PDF.

Additional Medicare tax

A 0.9 percent Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages, Railroad Retirement Tax Act compensation, and self-employment income that exceed a threshold amount based on the individual's filing status. The threshold amounts are $250,000 for married taxpayers who file jointly, $125,000 for married taxpayers who file separately, and $200,000 for all other taxpayers. An employer is responsible for withholding the Additional Medicare tax from Medicare wages or compensation it pays to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year.

For more information on the Additional Medicare tax, see Topic no. 560 and Questions and answers for the Additional Medicare tax.

Additional Medicare tax"|"The Affordable Care Act contains comprehensive health insurance reforms and includes tax provisions that affect individuals, families, businesses, insurers, tax-exempt organizations and government entities. These tax provisions contain important changes, including how individuals and families file their taxes. The law also contains benefits and responsibilities for other organizations and employers. The information under the following headings briefly explains some of the current income tax provisions of the legislation.

Small business health care tax credit

This small business health care tax credit helps small employers, including small tax-exempt employers, to afford the cost of covering health insurance premiums for their employees. It specifically targets employers with low and moderate-income workers. The maximum credit is up to 50% of contributions paid by small business employers for premiums, and up to 35% for small tax-exempt employers. In general, the credit is available to small employers that pay at least half the cost of single coverage for their employees. To qualify for the credit, a small employer must pay premiums on behalf of each employee enrolled in a qualified health plan offered by the employer through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace or qualify for an exception to this requirement.

If you're a small employer that qualifies for this credit, use Form 8941, Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums and attach it to your income tax return.

For additional information on this topic, refer to the Instructions for Form 8941PDF and the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit and the SHOP Marketplace page.

Health coverage for older children

Health coverage for an employee's children under 27 years of age is generally tax free to the employee. This health care tax benefit applies to various workplace and retiree health plans. As a result, employers with cafeteria plans – plans that allow employees to choose from a menu of tax-free benefit options and cash or taxable benefits – are allowed to permit employees to begin making pre-tax contributions to pay for this expanded benefit. Tax-free treatment for employer-provided health care to an employee's child has been extended until the end of the year in which the child turns age 26. The costs and reimbursements under employer health plans for coverage for an employee's eligible children are free of income, FICA and FUTA taxes, without regard to the IRS's dependency tests. This tax benefit also applies to self-employed individuals who qualify for the self-employed health insurance deduction on their federal income tax return.

Reporting of employer provided health coverage on Form W-2

Requesting a filing extension

Form 8809 - You can request an extension of time to file Forms W-2, W-2G, 1042-S, 1094-C, 1095 series, 1097-BTC, 1098 series, 1099 series, 3921, 3922, 5498 series, and 8027 information returns as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary, but not before January 1 of the year in which the return is due. Use Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns.

For most forms, Form 8809 may be filled out online via the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system; check FIRE for availability dates. You will need to log in to FIRE or create a FIRE account to use this option, but you don't need a Transmitter Control Code (TCC). At the Main Menu, select Extension of Time Request, then select Fill-in Extension Form and follow the instructions. There's no limit as to how many information returns for which you may request an automatic 30-day extension of time to file. A Form 8809 must be completed by the due date of the return for each filer requesting an extension. Forms 8809 completed online receive an instant acknowledgement on screen if the forms are completed properly and timely. This option becomes available the first week of January for the year the returns are due. Approved FIRE production account users with a TCC can also request extensions electronically through the FIRE system in a file formatted according to the specifications in Publication 1220, Specifications for Electronic Filing of Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2GPDF. A paper Form 8809 must be submitted if you already requested an automatic extension and now need to request an additional 30-day extension of time to file.

Please note that there are no automatic extensions of time to file Forms W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-QA, or 5498-QA. Because these forms are not eligible for an automatic extension of time to file, a paper Form 8809 must be filed in order to request an extension of time to file. For Forms W-2 or 1099-NEC, the filers must also meet one of the conditions listed on the form. Requests must be in writing and signed by the filer/transmitter or a person who is duly authorized to sign a return; an electronic additional extension of time to file is no longer an option. Additionally, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099-NEC have an accelerated due date of January 31.

Although TSO strongly encourages the use of the FIRE system to request an extension of time to file where available, you can also use a paper Form 8809. File the Form 8809 as soon as it's apparent you need the extension of time to file, and not later than the due date of the returns for which you're requesting the extension. TSO processes requests for extensions of time to file starting in January of the year the returns are due. Allow 30 days for TSO to respond to an extension request filed on paper. Mail to: Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Ogden, UT 84201-0209. Extension requests submitted on an obsolete Form 8809 and/or by fax are not accepted.

Extension requests for Forms 1099 series (excluding Forms 1099-NEC and 1099-QA) may also be filed electronically using the Information Returns Intake System (IRIS).

Use Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns.

For most forms, Form 8809 may be filled out online via the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system; check FIRE for availability dates. You will need to log in to FIRE or create a FIRE account to use this option, but you don't need a Transmitter Control Code (TCC). At the Main Menu, select Extension of Time Request, then select Fill-in Extension Form and follow the instructions. There's no limit as to how many information returns for which you may request an automatic 30-day extension of time to file. A Form 8809 must be completed by the due date of the return for each filer requesting an extension. Forms 8809 completed online receive an instant acknowledgement on screen if the forms are completed properly and timely.

TSO processes requests for extensions of time to file starting in January of the year the returns are due. Allow 30 days for TSO to respond to an extension request filed on paper.

Use Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns.

For most forms, Form 8809 may be filled out online via the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system; check FIRE for availability dates. You will need to log in to FIRE or create a FIRE account to use this option, but you don't need a Transmitter Control Code (TCC). At the Main Menu, select Extension of Time Request, then select Fill-in Extension Form and follow the instructions. There's no limit as to how many information returns for which you may request an automatic 30-day extension of time to file. A Form 8809 must be completed by the due date of the return for each filer requesting an extension. Forms 8809 completed online receive an instant acknowledgement on screen if the forms are completed properly and timely.

TSO processes requests for extensions of time to file starting in January of the year the returns are due. Allow 30 days for TSO to respond to an extension request filed on paper.

Requesting a filing extension

Form 8809 - You can request an extension of time to file Forms W-2, W-2G, 1042-S, 1094-C, 1095 series, 1097-BTC, 1098 series, 1099 series, 3921, 3922, 5498 series, and 8027 information returns as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary, but not before January 1 of the year in which the return is due. Use Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns.

For most forms, Form 8809 may be filled out online via the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system; check FIRE for availability dates. You will need to log in to FIRE or create a FIRE account to use this option, but you don't need a Transmitter Control Code (TCC). At the Main Menu, select Extension of Time Request, then select Fill-in Extension Form and follow the instructions. There's no limit as to how many information returns for which you may request an automatic 30-day extension of time to file. A Form 8809 must be completed by the due date of the return for each filer requesting an extension. Forms 8809 completed online receive an instant acknowledgement on screen if the forms are completed properly and timely. This option becomes available the first week of January for the year the returns are due. Approved FIRE production account users with a TCC can also request extensions electronically through the FIRE system in a file formatted according to the specifications in Publication 1220, Specifications for Electronic Filing of Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2GPDF. A paper Form 8809 must be submitted if you already requested an automatic extension and now need to request an additional 30-day extension of time to file.

Please note that there are no automatic extensions of time to file Forms W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-QA, or 5498-QA. Because these forms are not eligible for an automatic extension of time to file, a paper Form 8809 must be filed in order to request an extension of time to file. For Forms W-2 or 1099-NEC, the filers must also meet one of the conditions listed on the form. Requests must be in writing and signed by the filer/transmitter or a person who is duly authorized to sign a return; an electronic additional extension of time to file is no longer an option. Additionally, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099-NEC have an accelerated due date of January 31.

Although TSO strongly encourages the use of the FIRE system to request an extension of time to file where available, you can also use a paper Form 8809. File the Form 8809 as soon as it's apparent you need the extension of time to file, and not later than the due date of the returns for which you're requesting the extension. TSO processes requests for extensions of time to file starting in January of the year the returns are due. Allow 30 days for TSO to respond to an extension request filed on paper. Mail to: Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Ogden, UT 84201-0209. Extension requests submitted on an obsolete Form 8809 and/or by fax are not accepted.

Extension requests for Forms 1099 series (excluding Forms 1099-NEC and 1099-QA) may also be filed electronically using the Information Returns Intake System (IRIS).

Requesting a filing extension

Form 8809 - You can request an extension of time to file Forms W-2, W-2G, 1042-S, 1094-C, 1095 series, 1097-BTC, 1098 series, 1099 series, 3921, 3922, 5498 series, and 8027 information returns as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary, but not before January 1 of the year in which the return is due. Use Form 8809, Application for Extension of Time to File Information Returns.

For most forms, Form 8809 may be filled out online via the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system; check FIRE for availability dates. You will need to log in to FIRE or create a FIRE account to use this option, but you don't need a Transmitter Control Code (TCC). At the Main Menu, select Extension of Time Request, then select Fill-in Extension Form and follow the instructions. There's no limit as to how many information returns for which you may request an automatic 30-day extension of time to file. A Form 8809 must be completed by the due date of the return for each filer requesting an extension. Forms 8809 completed online receive an instant acknowledgement on screen if the forms are completed properly and timely. This option becomes available the first week of January for the year the returns are due. Approved FIRE production account users with a TCC can also request extensions electronically through the FIRE system in a file formatted according to the specifications in Publication 1220, Specifications for Electronic Filing of Forms 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2GPDF. A paper Form 8809 must be submitted if you already requested an automatic extension and now need to request an additional 30-day extension of time to file.

Please note that there are no automatic extensions of time to file Forms W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-QA, or 5498-QA. Because these forms are not eligible for an automatic extension of time to file, a paper Form 8809 must be filed in order to request an extension of time to file. For Forms W-2 or 1099-NEC, the filers must also meet one of the conditions listed on the form. Requests must be in writing and signed by the filer/transmitter or a person who is duly authorized to sign a return; an electronic additional extension of time to file is no longer an option. Additionally, Forms W-2 and Forms 1099-NEC have an accelerated due date of January 31.

Although TSO strongly encourages the use of the FIRE system to request an extension of time to file where available, you can also use a paper Form 8809. File the Form 8809 as soon as it's apparent you need the extension of time to file, and not later than the due date of the returns for which you're requesting the extension. TSO processes requests for extensions of time to file starting in January of the year the returns are due. Allow 30 days for TSO to respond to an extension request filed on paper. Mail to: Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Ogden, UT 84201-0209. Extension requests submitted on an obsolete Form 8809 and/or by fax are not accepted.

Extension requests for Forms 1099 series (excluding Forms 1099-NEC and 1099-QA) may also be filed electronically using the Information Returns Intake System (IRIS). Registered users with an IRIS TCC can access the Taxpayer Portal and select Request Automatic Extension from the dashboard. File an extension request as soon as you know an extension of time to file is necessary, but not before January 1 of the year in which the return is due. Submit a separate extension request for each issuer taxpayer identification number (TIN). After the submission, you'll receive an instant approval acknowledgement that will appear on screen if the request is complete, accurate and timely. For more information, refer to Publication 5717, Information Returns Intake System (IRIS), Taxpayer Portal User GuidePDF.

Submit a separate request for each filer that's requesting an extension of time to file. Request the extension by mailing Form 7004 to the address in the Instructions for Form 7004PDF.

Form 15397 – Use Form 15397, Application for Extension of Time to Furnish Recipient StatementsPDF to request an extension of time to furnish the statements to recipients by faxing this form to: Internal Revenue Service, Technical Services Operation, Attn: Extension of Time Coordinator, Fax: 877-477-0572 (within the U.S.) or 304-579-4105 (international).

"content: Because residents and nonresident aliens are taxed differently, it's important for you to determine your tax status.

Nonresident aliens

You're considered a nonresident alien for any period that you're neither a U.S. citizen nor a resident alien for tax purposes.

Resident aliens

You're considered a resident alien for a calendar year if you meet the green card test or the substantial presence test for the year.

Green card test

You're considered to have met the green card test, and are therefore a resident alien, if at any time during the calendar year you are a lawful permanent resident of the United States according to the immigration laws, and this status hasn't been revoked or administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned.

Substantial presence test

You satisfy the substantial presence test, and are therefore treated as a resident alien for a calendar year, if you have been physically present in the United States on at least:

To satisfy the 183-day requirement, count: All of the days you were present in the current year, One-third of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and One-sixth of the days you were present in the second year before the current year."|"Because residents and nonresident aliens are taxed differently, it's important for you to determine your tax status.

Nonresident aliens

You're considered a nonresident alien for any period that you're neither a U.S. citizen nor a resident alien for tax purposes.

Resident aliens

You're considered a resident alien for a calendar year if you meet the green card test or the substantial presence test for the year.

Green card test

You're considered to have met the green card test, and are therefore a resident alien, if at any time during the calendar year you are a lawful permanent resident of the United States according to the immigration laws, and this status hasn't been revoked or administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned.

Substantial presence test

You satisfy the substantial presence test, and are therefore treated as a resident alien for a calendar year, if you have been physically present in the United States on at least:

31 days during the current year, and

183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately preceding the current year. To satisfy the 183-day requirement, count: All of the days you were present in the current year, One-third of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and One-sixth of the days you were present in the second year before the current year.



For purposes of the substantial presence test, the term United States doesn't include U.S. possessions and territories or U.S. airspace. The United States includes the following areas:

All 50 states and the District of Columbia,

The territorial waters of the United States, and

The seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources.

Days of presence in the United States - Don't count the following days of presence in the United States for the substantial presence test: Days you commute to work in the United States from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico. You commute regularly if you commute to work in the United States on more than 75% of the workdays during your working period in the current year. Do not count the days you commute to work in the United States from your residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico.

Days you're in the United States for less than 24 hours when you're in transit between two places outside the United States, unless you attend a business meeting while in the United States.

Days you're in the United States as a crew member of a foreign vessel engaged in transportation between the United States and a foreign country or a U.S. possession. However, this exception doesn't apply if you otherwise engage in any trade or business in the United States on those days.

Days you intended to leave but couldn't leave the United States because of a medical condition or medical problem that arose while you were in the United States. Whether you intended to leave the United States on a particular day is determined based on all the facts and circumstances.

Days you're an exempt individual. Exempt individuals - You're an exempt individual, which means your days of presence in the United States are not counted for purposes of the substantial presence test, if you fall into any of the following categories: An individual temporarily present in the United States as a foreign government-related individual under an A or G visa . However, this category doesn't include household staff of a foreign government-related individual present in the United States under an A-3 or G-5 visa

. However, this category doesn't include household staff of a foreign government-related individual present in the United States under an A teacher or trainee temporarily present in the United States under a J or Q visa , who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. Generally, you won't be an exempt individual as a teacher or trainee if you were exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of 2 of the 6 preceding calendar years; however, you still may be treated as an exempt individual if all of the following conditions are met: You were exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of 3 (or fewer) of the 6 preceding calendar years, A foreign employer paid all of your compensation during the current year, You were present in the United States as a teacher or trainee in any of the prior 6 years, and A foreign employer paid all of your compensation during each of the preceding 6 years you were present in the United States as a teacher or trainee.

, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. Generally, you won't be an exempt individual as a teacher or trainee if you were exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of 2 of the 6 preceding calendar years; however, you still may be treated as an exempt individual if all of the following conditions are met: A student temporarily present in the United States under an F, J, M, or Q visa , who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa. You won't be an exempt individual as a student in the current year if you've been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of more than 5 calendar years unless you meet both of the following requirements: You establish that you don't intend to reside permanently in the United States; and You have substantially complied with the requirements of your visa.

, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa.

Even if you meet the substantial presence test, you may still be treated as a nonresident alien if you're present in the United States for fewer than 183 days during the current calendar year, you maintain a tax home in a foreign country during the year, you have a closer connection to that country than to the United States, and you timely file a Form 8840, Closer Connection Exception Statement for Aliens claiming you have a closer connection to a foreign country or countries. You can't claim a closer connection to a foreign country if you've applied, or took other steps during the year, to change your status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States, or you have an application pending for lawful permanent resident status (green card). Sometimes, a tax treaty between the United States and another country will provide special rules for determining residency for purposes of the treaty. If you claim to be solely a resident of a tax treaty jurisdiction, file Form 8833, Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b). See Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens for more information about the substantial presence test.

Choosing resident alien status

Even if you don't meet the green card test or substantial presence test for the current year (for example, 2023), or the prior year (2022), and you did not choose to be treated as a U.S. resident for part of the prior year (2022), but you meet the substantial presence test in the following year (2024), you can choose to be treated as a U.S. resident alien for part of the current year (2023) and be taxed as a dual-status alien for the current year (2023) by making the First-Year Election or, if you are a nonresident alien married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and you and your spouse make an election for you to be treated as a resident alien for the entire calendar year and all subsequent years until terminated. See Chapter 1 of Publication 519PDF for more information.

Dual-status tax year

If your status changes during the year from resident alien to nonresident alien or vice versa, you generally have a dual-status tax year. This usually happens in the year when you arrive in or depart from the United States. Your tax on the income for the two periods will differ under the provisions of the laws that apply to each period. See Publication 519 for more information about dual-status aliens.

Forms to file

If you're a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, you must file a return and report all of your income from U.S. sources, both from the trade or business and any U.S. source non-effectively connected income for which amounts have been withheld. If you're not engaged in a U.S. trade or business and have any U.S. source income on which the amount of tax withheld didn't fully satisfy the tax due, or you seek to claim a refund of overwithheld or overpaid tax, you must also file a Form 1040-NR. See the Instructions for Form 1040-NRPDF for more information.

If you had wages subject to income tax withholding and file on a calendar-year basis, your return is due by April 15.

If you didn't have wages subject to withholding and file on a calendar-year basis, your return is due by June 15.

Resident aliens must follow the same tax laws as U.S. citizens. If you're a resident alien, you must report your worldwide income from all sources, that is, income from both within and outside the United States. You'll file a Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors.

If you're a resident alien filing on a calendar-year basis, your return is due by April 15, and you should file it with the service center for your area.

For any due date that falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is delayed until the next business day.

31 days during the current year, and

183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately preceding the current year.

If you're a cash basis taxpayer, you can only take the foreign tax credit in the year you pay the foreign taxes unless you elect to claim the foreign tax credit in the year the taxes are accrued by checking the ""Accrued"" box in Part II of Form 1116 on a timely filed original return. Once you make this election, you must credit foreign taxes in the year they accrue on all future returns.

Foreign earned income and housing exclusions

You may not take either a credit or a deduction for the portion of foreign taxes paid or accrued on income you exclude under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion. There's no double taxation in this situation because that income isn't subject to U.S. income tax.

Computing the credit when filing Form 1116

If you use Form 1116 to figure the credit, your foreign tax credit will be the smaller of the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued, or the amount of U.S. tax attributable to your foreign source income. Compute the limit separately for passive income, income resourced under a tax treaty, section 901(j) income derived from sanctioned countries, income included under section 951A, foreign branch income, and general category income.

Carryback and carryover of unused credit

If you can't claim a credit for the full amount of qualified foreign income taxes you paid or accrued in the year, you're allowed a carryback and/or carryover of the unused foreign income tax, except that no carryback or carryover is allowed for foreign tax on income included under section 951A. You can carry back for one year and then carry forward for 10 years the unused foreign tax. For more information on this topic, see Publication 514.

Claiming without filing Form 1116

You can elect to claim the credit for eligible foreign taxes without filing Form 1116 if you meet all of the following requirements:

All of your foreign source income is passive income, such as interest and dividends,

All of your foreign source income and the foreign income taxes are reported to you on a qualified payee statement, such as Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-DIV, or Schedule K-1 from a partnership, S corporation, estate or trust, and,

The total of your qualified foreign taxes isn't more than the limit given in the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) PDF for the filing status you're using, or in the Instructions for Form 1040-NR PDF (if filing Form 1040-NR).

If you claim the credit without filing Form 1116, you can't carry back or carry forward any unused foreign tax to or from this year.

This election isn't available to estates or trusts.

Amending your return to claim the tax credit

If you claimed an itemized deduction for a given year for eligible foreign taxes, you can choose instead to claim a foreign tax credit that'll result in a refund for that year by filing an amended return on Form 1040-X within 10 years from the original due date of your return. The 10-year period also applies to calculate corrections of your previously claimed foreign tax credit.

If the foreign income taxes you claimed as a credit are refunded to you or otherwise reduced, you must file an amended return on Form 1040-X reporting the reduced foreign tax credit no later than the due date (with extensions) of your return for the year in which the foreign taxes were refunded or reduced.

Choosing a credit or a deduction

Instead of claiming a credit for eligible foreign taxes, you can choose to deduct foreign income taxes. To choose the deduction, you must deduct foreign income taxes on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions. To choose the foreign tax credit, you generally must complete Form 1116 and attach it to your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR.

Foreign taxes that don't qualify for a credit:

Taxes paid to a foreign country that you don't legally owe, including amount eligible for a refund by the foreign country. Taxes paid to a foreign country that are offset or reduced by a tax credit. Taxes imposed by a foreign country only because you could claim a foreign tax credit against the U.S. tax liability for such foreign income taxes paid or accrued. Taxes imposed by and paid to certain foreign countries. These countries are those designated by the Secretary of State as countries that repeatedly provide support for acts of international terrorism, countries with which the United States doesn't have or doesn't conduct diplomatic relations, or countries whose governments aren't recognized by the United States and aren't otherwise eligible to purchase defense articles or services under the Arms Export Control Act. For a list of these countries, see Publication 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals. Foreign taxes withheld on a dividend from a corporation, if you haven't held the stock for at least 16 days within the 31-day period that begins 15 days before the ex-dividend date. This required holding period is greater for preferred-stock dividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days. See section 901(k)(3) or Publication 514 PDF . Foreign taxes withheld on a dividend to the extent that you have to make related payments on positions in substantially similar or related property. Foreign taxes withheld on income or gain (other than dividends) from property if you haven't held the property for at least 16 days within the 31-day period that begins 15 days before the date on which the right to receive the payment arises. See section 901(l) or Publication 514. Foreign taxes withheld on income or gain (other than dividends) from property to the extent you have to make related payments on positions in substantially similar or related property. Foreign taxes that are used to provide, directly or indirectly, a subsidy to you, a person or business related to you, or any party transacting with you. Taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country in connection with the purchase or sale of oil or gas extracted in that country if you don't have an economic interest in the oil or gas, and the purchase price or sales price is different from the fair market value of the oil or gas at the time of the purchase or sale. Foreign taxes paid or accrued on income for which you are claiming an exclusion on Form 8873, Extraterritorial Income Exclusion. However, see section 943(d) for an exception for certain withholding taxes. The disqualified portion of any foreign tax paid or accrued in connection with a covered asset acquisition. Covered asset acquisitions include certain acquisitions that result in a stepped-up basis for U.S. tax purposes. For more information, see section 901(m) and the regulations under that section. Foreign taxes disallowed under section 965(g) and Regulations section 1.965-5.

You can't take a credit for any interest or penalties you must pay.

For more information, see Foreign Taxes for Which You Cannot Take a Credit in Publication 514.

Choosing a credit or a deduction

Instead of claiming a credit for eligible foreign taxes, you can choose to deduct foreign income taxes. To choose the deduction, you must deduct foreign income taxes on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions. To choose the foreign tax credit, you generally must complete Form 1116 and attach it to your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR or Form 1040-NR. You must choose either the foreign tax credit or itemized deduction for all foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year. This is an annual choice. However, even if you take the credit for eligible foreign taxes for the year, you can take a deduction for the following.

Foreign taxes not allowed as a credit because of boycott provisions.

Taxes paid to certain foreign countries for which a credit has been denied, as described in item 4 above.

Taxes on income or gain that aren't creditable because you don't meet the holding period requirement, as described in item 5 or 7 above.

Taxes on income or gain that aren't creditable because you have to make related payments, as described in item 6 or 8 above.

Certain taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country in connection with the purchase or sale of oil or gas extracted in that country, as described in item 10 above.

Taxes on income or gain that aren't creditable because they were paid or accrued in connection with a covered asset acquisition, as described in item 12 above.

If you are an accrual basis taxpayer or if you elected to claim your foreign tax credit on an accrual basis, taxes paid that relate to a prior tax year in which you elected to claim a deduction instead of a credit in that prior year. See Regulations section 1.901-1(c)(3).

If you're a cash basis taxpayer, you can only take the foreign tax credit in the year you pay the foreign taxes unless you elect to claim the foreign tax credit in the year the taxes are accrued by checking the ""Accrued"" box in Part II of Form 1116 on a timely filed original return. Once you make this election, you must credit foreign taxes in the year they accrue on all future returns.

Foreign earned income and housing exclusions

You may not take either a credit or a deduction for the portion of foreign taxes paid or accrued on income you exclude under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion. There's no double taxation in this situation because that income isn't subject to U.S. income tax.

Computing the credit when filing Form 1116

If you use Form 1116 to figure the credit, your foreign tax credit will be the smaller of the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued, or the amount of U.S. tax attributable to your foreign source income. Compute the limit separately for passive income, income resourced under a tax treaty, section 901(j) income derived from sanctioned countries, income included under section 951A, foreign branch income, and general category income.

Carryback and carryover of unused credit

If you can't claim a credit for the full amount of qualified foreign income taxes you paid or accrued in the year, you're allowed a carryback and/or carryover of the unused foreign income tax, except that no carryback or carryover is allowed for foreign tax on income included under section 951A. You can carry back for one year and then carry forward for 10 years the unused foreign tax. For more information on this topic, see Publication 514.

Claiming without filing Form 1116

You can elect to claim the credit for eligible foreign taxes without filing Form 1116 if you meet all of the following requirements:

All of your foreign source income is passive income, such as interest and dividends,

All of your foreign source income and the foreign income taxes are reported to you on a qualified payee statement, such as Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-DIV, or Schedule K-1 from a partnership, S corporation, estate or trust, and,

The total of your qualified foreign taxes isn't more than the limit given in the Instructions for Form 1040 (and Form 1040-SR) PDF for the filing status you're using, or in the Instructions for Form 1040-NR PDF (if filing Form 1040-NR).

If you claim the credit without filing Form 1116, you can't carry back or carry forward any unused foreign tax to or from this year.

This election isn't available to estates or trusts.

Amending your return to claim the tax credit

If you claimed an itemized deduction for a given year for eligible foreign taxes, you can choose instead to claim a foreign tax credit that'll result in a refund for that year by filing an amended return on Form 1040-X within 10 years from the original due date of your return. The 10-year period also applies to calculate corrections of your previously claimed foreign tax credit.

If the foreign income taxes you claimed as a credit are refunded to you or otherwise reduced, you must file an amended return on Form 1040-X reporting the reduced foreign tax credit no later than the due date (with extensions) of your return for the year in which the foreign taxes were refunded or reduced.

For federal tax purposes only

An ITIN is issued for federal tax filing purposes only and doesn't entitle you to social security benefits nor does it make you eligible for the earned income credit. The ITIN creates no inference concerning your immigration status or your right to work in the United States.

Applying for an ITIN

You must file Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification NumberPDF to apply for an ITIN and to show that you have a federal tax purpose for seeking the ITIN. Along with the completed Form W-7, you'll submit identity documents and either a federal tax return or other documentation to show the federal tax purpose for which you need the ITIN.

The identity documents must verify both your identity and your foreign status. Most applicants must include original documents. Nonresident aliens claiming tax treaty benefits must submit original documents or copies certified by the issuing agency. Dependents of U.S. military personnel are required to submit original documents or certified copies unless the required documents to prove foreign status and identity are notarized by an agent of the Department of Defense. A copy of a U.S. military ID is required if the documents are notarized. If you don't submit a passport document (with a date of entry, if for a dependent), you must provide a combination of at least two documents that are current (that is, not expired) and that, taken together, (1) verify your identity (contain your name and a photograph), and (2) support your claim of foreign status. An exclusive list of documents that are acceptable for this purpose is included in the Instructions for Form W-7. Some examples of acceptable documentation include national identification card (showing photo, name, current address, date of birth, and expiration date), civil birth certificate, foreign driver's license, or visa issued by the Department of State.

If the ITIN is for a dependent, and the dependent's passport doesn't have a date of entry, then you may submit medical records, if the dependent is under the age of 6, or school records from a U.S. facility, if the dependent is at least 6 years of age. However, if you're living abroad and have adopted a foreign child or have had a foreign child legally placed in your home pending an adoption, that child may be eligible for an ITIN. If the dependent is a minor, the documentation must establish the relationship between the dependent and the representative signing the application on the dependent's behalf. This could include a birth certificate, adoption papers, or other court-appointed papers showing legal guardianship.

Applying by mail or in person - You can apply for your ITIN by mail or in person at designated IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) in the United States. TACs operate by appointment only. If you apply by mail, use the address shown in the Form W-7 Instructions and in Publication 1915, Understanding Your IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification NumberPDF. If applying outside the United States, see Obtaining an ITIN from abroad for more information. If you apply in person, the IRS will review your documents and return them to you immediately. Applicants may also submit their applications by using the services of a Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA). CAAs are individuals, businesses, or organizations authorized by the IRS to assist taxpayers in the ITIN application process. After reviewing your application, the IRS will return your documentation to you. If your original documents haven't been returned within 60 days, you may call 800-829-1040 (in the United States) or 267-941-1000 (outside the United States), to find out about the status of your documents. Allow 7 weeks for the IRS to notify you in writing of your ITIN application status (up to 11 weeks if you submit the application during peak tax time (January 15 through April 30) or from abroad). Get up-to-date status on current IRS operations and services.

Expiration of ITINs

Any ITIN that's not used on a federal income tax return for three consecutive tax years, either as the ITIN of an individual who files the return or as the ITIN of a dependent included on a return, will expire on December 31 of the third consecutive tax year of non-use. See Notice 2016-48PDF and Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for more information.

For federal tax purposes only

An ITIN is issued for federal tax filing purposes only and doesn't entitle you to social security benefits nor does it make you eligible for the earned income credit. The ITIN creates no inference concerning your immigration status or your right to work in the United States.

Applying for an ITIN

You must file Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification NumberPDF to apply for an ITIN and to show that you have a federal tax purpose for seeking the ITIN. Along with the completed Form W-7, you'll submit identity documents and either a federal tax return or other documentation to show the federal tax purpose for which you need the ITIN.

The identity documents must verify both your identity and your foreign status. Most applicants must include original documents. Nonresident aliens claiming tax treaty benefits must submit original documents or copies certified by the issuing agency. Dependents of U.S. military personnel are required to submit original documents or certified copies unless the required documents to prove foreign status and identity are notarized by an agent of the Department of Defense. A copy of a U.S. military ID is required if the documents are notarized. If you don't submit a passport document (with a date of entry, if for a dependent), you must provide a combination of at least two documents that are current (that is, not expired) and that, taken together, (1) verify your identity (contain your name and a photograph), and (2) support your claim of foreign status.

Some examples of acceptable documentation include national identification card (showing photo, name, current address, date of birth, and expiration date), civil birth certificate, foreign driver's license, or visa issued by the Department of State.

If the ITIN is for a dependent, and the dependent's passport doesn't have a date of entry, then you may submit medical records, if the dependent is under the age of 6, or school records from a U.S. facility, if the dependent is at least 6 years of age. However, if you're living abroad and have adopted a foreign child or have had a foreign child legally placed in your home pending an adoption, that child may be eligible for an ITIN. If the dependent is a minor, the documentation must establish the relationship between the dependent and the representative signing the application on the dependent's behalf. This could include a birth certificate, adoption papers, or other court-appointed papers showing legal guardianship.

Applying by mail or in person - You can apply for your ITIN by mail or in person at designated IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) in the United States. TACs operate by appointment only. If you apply by mail, use the address shown in the Form W-7 Instructions and in Publication 1915, Understanding Your IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification NumberPDF. If applying outside the United States, see Obtaining an ITIN from abroad for more information. If you apply in person, the IRS will review your documents and return them to you immediately. Applicants may also submit their applications by using the services of a Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA). CAAs are individuals, businesses, or organizations authorized by the IRS to assist taxpayers in the ITIN application process. After reviewing your application, the IRS will return your documentation to you. If your original documents haven't been returned within 60 days, you may call 800-829-1040 (in the United States) or 267-941-1000 (outside the United States), to find out about the status of your documents. Allow 7 weeks for the IRS to notify you in writing of your ITIN application status (up to 11 weeks if you submit the application during peak tax time (January 15 through April 30) or from abroad). Get up-to-date status on current IRS operations and services.

Expiration of ITINs

Any ITIN that's not used on a federal income tax return for three consecutive tax years, either as the ITIN of an individual who files the return or as the ITIN of a dependent included on a return, will expire on December 31 of the third consecutive tax year of non-use. See Notice 2016-48PDF and Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for more information.

Expiration of ITINs"|"A taxpayer identification number (TIN) is required on all returns, statements, and other tax-related documents and you must provide it upon request to any other person who needs it to comply with the tax law. For most individuals, their TIN is a social security number (SSN). A foreign person, who doesn't have and can't get an SSN, must use an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). A foreign person may be a resident alien for income tax purposes based on days present in the United States. See discussion of the ""Substantial presence test"" in Topic no. 851, Resident and nonresident aliens for more information.

Examples of individuals who need an ITIN

A nonresident alien individual claiming a tax treaty benefit

A nonresident alien filing a U.S. tax return

A resident alien (who is treated as a resident alien for income tax purposes based on days present in the United States ) who files a U.S. tax return

) who files a U.S. tax return A resident or nonresident alien individual who can be claimed as a dependent of a U.S. citizen or resident alien on a U.S. tax return

A resident or nonresident alien spouse who isn't filing a U.S. federal tax return (including a joint return) but who can be claimed as a dependent on a U.S. tax return

A resident or nonresident alien electing to file a joint tax return with a spouse who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien

A nonresident alien student, professor, or researcher filing a U.S. tax return or claiming an exception

A resident or nonresident alien individual who can be claimed as a dependent or a spouse of a nonresident alien U.S. visa holder

For federal tax purposes only

An ITIN is issued for federal tax filing purposes only and doesn't entitle you to social security benefits nor does it make you eligible for the earned income credit. The ITIN creates no inference concerning your immigration status or your right to work in the United States.

Applying for an ITIN

You must file Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification NumberPDF to apply for an ITIN and to show that you have a federal tax purpose for seeking the ITIN. Along with the completed Form W-7, you'll submit identity documents and either a federal tax return or other documentation to show the federal tax purpose for which you need the ITIN.

The identity documents must verify both your identity and your foreign status. Most applicants must include original documents. Nonresident aliens claiming tax treaty benefits must submit original documents or copies certified by the issuing agency. Dependents of U.S. military personnel are required to submit original documents or certified copies unless the required documents to prove foreign status and identity are notarized by an agent of the Department of Defense. A copy of a U.S. military ID is required if the documents are notarized. If you don't submit a passport document (with a date of entry, if for a dependent), you must provide a combination of at least two documents that are current (that is, not expired) and that, taken together, (1) verify your identity (contain your name and a photograph), and (2) support your claim of foreign status. An exclusive list of documents that are acceptable for this purpose is included in the Instructions for Form W-7. Some examples of acceptable documentation include national identification card (showing photo, name, current address, date of birth, and expiration date), civil birth certificate, foreign driver's license, or visa issued by the Department of State.

If the ITIN is for a dependent, and the dependent's passport doesn't have a date of entry, then you may submit medical records, if the dependent is under the age of 6, or school records from a U.S. facility, if the dependent is at least 6 years of age. However, if you're living abroad and have adopted a foreign child or have had a foreign child legally placed in your home pending an adoption, that child may be eligible for an ITIN.

You do this by obtaining from the IRS a tax clearance document, commonly called a departure permit or sailing permit.

Not required to obtain alien tax clearance

The following six categories of people aren't required to obtain a departure or sailing permit:

Category 1 - A representative of a foreign government entering with a diplomatic passport, members of their household and servants accompanying them.

Category 2 - Employees of international organizations, foreign governments (unless exempt under category 1) and members of their households.

*Note: Aliens in category (1) or (2) who filed a waiver under §247(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, must get a sailing or departure permit even if their income is exempt from U.S. tax due to a tax treaty, consular or international agreement.

Category 3 - Alien students, industrial trainees and exchange visitors, including their spouses and children who enter on an F-1, F-2, H-3, H-4, J-1, J-2, or Q visa and who receive no income from U.S. sources while in the United States under those visas other than the exceptions described in Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens."|"If you're a resident or a nonresident alien departing the United States, you usually have to show that you have complied with the U.S. income tax laws before you can depart.

For additional information about these excluded categories, refer to Publication 519 and Departing Alien Clearance.

If you don't fall into one of the above categories, you must obtain a departure or sailing permit, which must be presented at the point of departure. Obtain a permit by filing the applicable Form 2063, U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Statement or Form 1040-C, U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Return with your local IRS office (by appointment only) before you leave the United States.

Form 2063

This short form asks for certain information but doesn't include a tax computation. The following departing aliens can get their departure or sailing permits by filing Form 2063:

Resident or nonresident aliens who have had no taxable income for the tax year and preceding year up to and including the date of departure, if the period for filing the income tax return for that year hasn't passed.

Resident aliens who received taxable income during the tax year or preceding year and whose departure won't hinder the collection of tax as determined by the Area Director.

However, if the IRS has information indicating that the alien is leaving to avoid paying their income tax, they must file a Form 1040-C.

Aliens in either of these categories who haven't filed an income tax return or paid income tax for any tax year must file the return and pay the income tax before they can be issued a departure or sailing permit on Form 2063.

Form 1040-C

If you must get a departure or sailing permit and you don't qualify to file Form 2063, you must file Form 1040-C.

Ordinarily, you must report on Form 1040-C and pay the tax on all income received or reasonably expected to be received during the tax year up to and including the date of departure. When you pay any tax shown as due on the Form 1040-C, file all returns and pay all tax due for previous years, you'll receive a departure or sailing permit. However, the IRS may permit you to furnish a bond guaranteeing payment instead of paying the taxes for certain years.

Form 1040-C is not an annual U.S. income tax return. You must file a final income tax return.

The tax paid with Form 1040-C should be taken as a credit against the total tax liability on your income tax return after your tax year ends. If the tax computation on Form 1040-C results in an overpayment, there is no tax to pay at the time you file that return. However, the IRS cannot provide a refund at the time of departure. If you are due a refund, you must file either Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, at the end of the tax year to claim a refund.

When and how to apply for a departure or sailing permit

You must obtain your departure or sailing permit before you leave the United States. You should apply for the departure or sailing permit no earlier than 30 days before you plan to leave but at least two weeks in advance of your departure. To get your departure permit, make an appointment at your nearest Taxpayer Assistance Center. If you're married to an alien who is leaving the country with you, both of you must go to the IRS office.

You must bring with you all the following records and information for the current year that apply to you:

Your valid passport and alien registration card or visa. Copies of your U.S. income tax returns filed for the past two years.

However, if the IRS has information indicating that the alien is leaving to avoid paying their income tax, they must file a Form 1040-C.

Aliens in either of these categories who haven't filed an income tax return or paid income tax for any tax year must file the return and pay the income tax before they can be issued a departure or sailing permit on Form 2063.

Form 1040-C

If you must get a departure or sailing permit and you don't qualify to file Form 2063, you must file Form 1040-C.

Ordinarily, you must report on Form 1040-C and pay the tax on all income received or reasonably expected to be received during the tax year up to and including the date of departure. When you pay any tax shown as due on the Form 1040-C, file all returns and pay all tax due for previous years, you'll receive a departure or sailing permit. However, the IRS may permit you to furnish a bond guaranteeing payment instead of paying the taxes for certain years.

Form 1040-C is not an annual U.S. income tax return. You must file a final income tax return.

The tax paid with Form 1040-C should be taken as a credit against the total tax liability on your income tax return after your tax year ends. If the tax computation on Form 1040-C results in an overpayment, there is no tax to pay at the time you file that return. However, the IRS cannot provide a refund at the time of departure. If you are due a refund, you must file either Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return or Form 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, at the end of the tax year to claim a refund.

When and how to apply for a departure or sailing permit

You must obtain your departure or sailing permit before you leave the United States. You should apply for the departure or sailing permit no earlier than 30 days before you plan to leave but at least two weeks in advance of your departure. To get your departure permit, make an appointment at your nearest Taxpayer Assistance Center. If you're married to an alien who is leaving the country with you, both of you must go to the IRS office.

Substantiation to prove your deductions, business expenses, and dependents claimed on your returns. A statement from each employer showing the wages paid and tax withheld from January 1 of the current year to the date of departure if you were an employee. If you were self-employed, you must bring a statement of income and expenses up to the date you plan to leave. Proof of any estimated tax payments made for the past year and this year. Documents showing any gain or loss from the sale of personal and/or real property, including capital assets and merchandise. Documents concerning scholarships or fellowship grants received. Documents indicating you qualify for any special tax treaty benefits claimed. Document verifying your date of departure from the United States, such as an airline ticket.

Not required to obtain alien tax clearance

The following six categories of people aren't required to obtain a departure or sailing permit:

Category 1 - A representative of a foreign government entering with a diplomatic passport, members of their household and servants accompanying them.

Category 2 - Employees of international organizations, foreign governments (unless exempt under category 1) and members of their households.

Category 3 - Alien students, industrial trainees and exchange visitors, including their spouses and children who enter on an F-1, F-2, H-3, H-4, J-1, J-2, or Q visa and who receive no income from U.S. sources while in the United States under those visas other than the exceptions described in Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.

Category 4 - Alien students, their spouses and children who enter on an M-1 or M-2 visa and who receive no income from U.S. sources while in the United States under those visas other than the exceptions described in Publication 519.

Category 5 - Certain other aliens temporarily in the United States who receive no taxable income unless the IRS believes they had taxable income during the year and their leaving the United States would hinder the collection of tax (e.g., (1) Alien military trainees in the United States sponsored under DOD orders; (2) Alien visitors for pleasure on a B-2 visa or business visitors on a B-1 or B-2 visa who don't stay in the United States or U.S. possession more than 90 days; (3) Aliens in transit through the United States or U.S. possession on a C-1 Visa; and (4) Aliens entering the United States or U.S. possession on a border-crossing ID card for pleasure, transit or business for no more than 90 days).

"Foreign tax credit

If you must report income from Puerto Rican sources on your U.S. income tax return, then you can claim a foreign tax credit for income taxes paid to Puerto Rico on the same income. To calculate your foreign tax credit, you must reduce the income taxes paid to Puerto Rico by the amount of income taxes allocable to excluded Puerto Rican source income. When claiming a foreign tax credit, you must complete Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit. See Topic no. 856 for more information about the foreign tax credit.

For more information about how to allocate deductions and credits with respect to excluded income as well as how to determine if you're a bona fide resident, refer to Topic no. 901, Publication 570, and Publication 1321PDF."|"If you're a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, you'll be able to exclude income from Puerto Rican sources on your U.S. income tax return. However, this exclusion from U.S. income taxation doesn't apply to amounts you receive for services performed as an employee of the United States or any agency thereof. If you're a bona fide resident and have to file a U.S. income tax return, then you can claim deductions and credits that are allocable to or chargeable against income required to be reported on your U.S. income tax return. You can't claim deductions and credits allocable to or chargeable against Puerto Rican source income that you excluded on your U.S. income tax return.

In addition, you can claim deductions and credits that aren't specifically attributable to income from either Puerto Rican or non-Puerto Rican sources, but you must allocate such deductions and credits between income from Puerto Rican sources and income from all other sources (worldwide) to find the part that you can claim on your U.S. income tax return. Examples of these types of allocable deductions and credits are the standard deduction and certain itemized deductions such as medical expenses, charitable contributions, real estate taxes, and mortgage interest on your personal residence.

Child tax credit expanded to residents of Puerto Rico

Beginning with tax year 2021, eligibility for the child tax credit (CTC) expanded to residents of Puerto Rico with one or more qualifying children. For 2023, the initial amount of the CTC is $2,000 for each qualifying child. The portion of the CTC that can be claimed as a refundable credit (the additional child tax credit, or ACTC) increased for 2023 to $1,600 for each qualifying child.

Residents of Puerto Rico must file a federal tax return with the IRS to claim the CTC, even if they don't have a filing requirement and have little or no income from a job, business or other source. The credit can be claimed on:

Form 1040-SS (SP) is a Spanish-language form. Form 1040 and Form 1040-SR have Spanish-language versions.

Any of these tax returns can be filed to claim the CTC even after the filing deadline. In fact, families who don't owe taxes to the IRS can file their 2021 tax return and claim the CTC for the 2021 tax year at any point until April 15, 2025, without any penalty.

Foreign tax credit

If you must report income from Puerto Rican sources on your U.S. income tax return, then you can claim a foreign tax credit for income taxes paid to Puerto Rico on the same income.

"content: Employers in Puerto Rico are subject to the taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) (Social Security and Medicare taxes) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). An employer is a person or organization for whom a worker performs services as an employee. As an employer, you're required to withhold, report, and pay employment taxes to the United States on wages paid.

To file the various employment tax returns, you need an employer identification number (EIN). If you don't have an EIN, you may apply for one online. You may also use Form SS-4 or Form SS-4 (sp) to apply for an EIN by fax or mail (use only one method for each entity so you don't receive more than one EIN for an entity). For more information about EINs, see Topic no. 755.

Social Security and Medicare

FICA taxes are used to finance the Social Security and Medicare systems. FICA taxes consist of two components: Social Security tax and the Medicare tax. You must withhold the employee portion of FICA taxes from your employees' wages and contribute the employer portion of FICA tax. The current tax rate for Social Security is 6.2% for the employer and 6.2% for the employee, or 12.4% total. The current tax rate for Medicare is 1.45% for the employer and 1.45% for the employee, or 2.9% total.

Additional Medicare tax

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status. Employers are responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax on an individual's wages paid in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year, without regard to filing status. An employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and Answers for the Additional Medicare Tax.

Federal employment tax forms

The forms used by employers in Puerto Rico to report the FICA taxes are the English (or Spanish) versions of: Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Schedule H (Form 1040) (for household employers). In addition, the forms used by employers in Puerto Rico to make corrections to employment taxes are: Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, and a corrected Schedule H. Household employers may need to file Form 1040-X also.

Form 941 – If you're not an agricultural employer or an employer with only household employees, and all your employees are bona fide residents of Puerto Rico, file Form 941 to report all wages paid, tips your employees reported to you, other compensation, and FICA taxes. You must file Form 941 to report your employment taxes unless the IRS has notified you that you're required to file Form 944. Form 941 is filed quarterly and is due the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. For example, for wages you paid from January through March (the first quarter of the year), Form 941 is due April 30. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide.

Form 943 – If you're an agricultural employer in Puerto Rico, you must file Form 943 to report the employer's and the employee's share of the FICA taxes for agricultural employees. To see if you're required to withhold and pay FICA taxes on your agricultural employees, refer to Publication 15. Form 943 is filed annually and is due by January 31 after the end of the calendar year. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. Most employers are required to deposit both the employer and employee portions of FICA taxes instead of paying them with the Form 943.

Form 944 – If you're not an agricultural employer or an employer with only household employees, you may have been notified to file Form 944. Form 944 is filed annually by certain small businesses and is due by January 31 after the end of the calendar year. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day.

Employers aren't permitted to file Form 944 unless they requested this on their Form SS-4 or were notified by the IRS that they qualify to file Form 944. For employers who may be eligible to file Form 944 because their estimated annual employment tax liability is $1,000 or less, or for employers required to file Form 944 who want to file Form 941 instead, see the Instructions for Form 944PDF.

Employers notified to file Form 944, whose businesses grow during the year and exceed the $1,000 eligibility threshold, must still file Form 944 for the year. Employers who exceed the eligibility threshold will be notified by the IRS that their filing requirement has been changed to Form 941 beginning in a particular year.

Schedule H (Form 1040) – If you pay a household employee cash wages, you may be required to withhold and pay FICA taxes on all wages you pay to that employee. To see if you're required to withhold and pay these taxes, see Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide. File Schedule H (Form 1040)PDF to report and pay FICA taxes corresponding to the employer and the employee for all household employees.

Household employees include housekeepers, maids, babysitters, gardeners and others who work in or around your residence as your employee. Repairmen, plumbers, contractors, and other businesspeople who are self-employed and own their equipment and control how the work is performed, normally aren't considered household employees.

Tax deposits – Most employers (excluding household employers) are required to deposit their FICA taxes instead of paying them with the employment tax return. If you're filing Form 944, you may be able to pay your FICA taxes with your return. If you have deposited all of your tax on time, for Forms 943 and 944 you may file by February 10 (or the next business day, if applicable) and for Form 941, you may file by the 10th day of the second month following the end of the quarter (or the next business day, if applicable). See Publication 15 for filing and deposit requirements for Forms 941, 943 and 944. Household employers should use Publication 926.

For additional information, Form 941 and Form 944 filers can refer to Topic no. 757 and Topic no. 758 or the Instructions for the related form. Agricultural employers filing Form 943 can refer to Topic no. 760 or the Instructions for Form 943PDF.

Form 940 is filed annually and is due by January 31 after the end of the calendar year. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. Most employers are required to deposit FUTA taxes.

An employer is a person or organization for whom a worker performs services as an employee. As an employer, you're required to withhold, report, and pay employment taxes to the United States on wages paid.

To file the various employment tax returns, you need an employer identification number (EIN). If you don't have an EIN, you may apply for one online. You may also use Form SS-4 or Form SS-4 (sp) to apply for an EIN by fax or mail (use only one method for each entity so you don't receive more than one EIN for an entity). For more information about EINs, see Topic no. 755.

Social Security and Medicare

FICA taxes are used to finance the Social Security and Medicare systems. FICA taxes consist of two components: Social Security tax and the Medicare tax. You must withhold the employee portion of FICA taxes from your employees' wages and contribute the employer portion of FICA tax. The current tax rate for Social Security is 6.2% for the employer and 6.2% for the employee, or 12.4% total. The current tax rate for Medicare is 1.45% for the employer and 1.45% for the employee, or 2.9% total.

Additional Medicare tax

Additional Medicare tax applies to an individual's Medicare wages that exceed a threshold amount based on the taxpayer's filing status. Employers are responsible for withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare tax on an individual's wages paid in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year, without regard to filing status. An employer is required to begin withholding Additional Medicare tax in the pay period in which it pays wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. There's no employer match for Additional Medicare tax. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8959 and Questions and Answers for the Additional Medicare Tax.

Federal employment tax forms

The forms used by employers in Puerto Rico to report the FICA taxes are the English (or Spanish) versions of: Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Schedule H (Form 1040) (for household employers). In addition, the forms used by employers in Puerto Rico to make corrections to employment taxes are: Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, and a corrected Schedule H. Household employers may need to file Form 1040-X also.

Form 941 – If you're not an agricultural employer or an employer with only household employees, and all your employees are bona fide residents of Puerto Rico, file Form 941 to report all wages paid, tips your employees reported to you, other compensation, and FICA taxes. You must file Form 941 to report your employment taxes unless the IRS has notified you that you're required to file Form 944. Form 941 is filed quarterly and is due the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. For example, for wages you paid from January through March (the first quarter of the year), Form 941 is due April 30. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. The term legal holiday means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For a list of legal holidays, see Publication 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide.

Form 943 – If you're an agricultural employer in Puerto Rico, you must file Form 943 to report the employer's and the employee's share of the FICA taxes for agricultural employees. To see if you're required to withhold and pay FICA taxes on your agricultural employees, refer to Publication 15. Form 943 is filed annually and is due by January 31 after the end of the calendar year. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day. Most employers are required to deposit both the employer and employee portions of FICA taxes instead of paying them with the Form 943.

Form 944 – If you're not an agricultural employer or an employer with only household employees, you may have been notified to file Form 944. Form 944 is filed annually by certain small businesses and is due by January 31 after the end of the calendar year. If the due date for filing a return falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, you may file the return on the next business day.

Employers aren't permitted to file Form 944 unless they requested this on their Form SS-4 or were notified by the IRS that they qualify to file Form 944. For employers who may be eligible to file Form 944 because their estimated annual employment tax liability is $1,000 or less, or for employers required to file Form 944 who want to file Form 941 instead, see the Instructions for Form 944PDF.

Employers notified to file Form 944, whose businesses grow during the year and exceed the $1,000 eligibility threshold, must still file Form 944 for the year. Employers who exceed the eligibility threshold will be notified by the IRS that their filing requirement has been changed to Form 941 beginning in a particular year.

Schedule H (Form 1040) – If you pay a household employee cash wages, you may be required to withhold and pay FICA taxes on all wages you pay to that employee. To see if you're required to withhold and pay these taxes, see Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide. File Schedule H (Form 1040)PDF to report and pay FICA taxes corresponding to the employer and the employee for all household employees.

Household employees include housekeepers, maids, babysitters, gardeners and others who work in or around your residence as your employee. Repairmen, plumbers, contractors, and other businesspeople who are self-employed and own their equipment and control how the work is performed, normally aren't considered household employees.

Tax deposits – Most employers (excluding household employers) are required to deposit their FICA taxes instead of paying them with the employment tax return. If you're filing Form 944, you may be able to pay your FICA taxes with your return. If you have deposited all of your tax on time, for Forms 943 and 944 you may file by February 10 (or the next business day, if applicable) and for Form 941, you may file by the 10th day of the second month following the end of the quarter (or the next business day, if applicable). See Publication 15 for filing and deposit requirements for Forms 941, 943 and 944. Household employers should use Publication 926.

For additional information, Form 941 and Form 944 filers can refer to Topic no. 757 and Topic no. 758 or the Instructions for the related form. Agricultural employers filing Form 943 can refer to Topic no. 760 or the Instructions for Form 943PDF.

To see if you're required to pay FUTA taxes, refer to Publication 15PDF or Publication 926PDF (for household employers).
